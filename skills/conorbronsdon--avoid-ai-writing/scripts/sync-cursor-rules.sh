# Regenerate cursor-rules/avoid-ai-writing.mdc from the canonical root SKILL.md.
# Root SKILL.md is the single source of truth; the Cursor rule is generated.
# Run this after editing SKILL.md. CI fails if the copy is out of sync.
#
# The rule is a copy-out artifact: users curl it into their own project's
# .cursor/rules/, where nothing else from this repo exists. Five spans in
# SKILL.md point at files in this repo, so the generator rewrites them the
# same way the claude-code-templates vendoring did (davila7/claude-code-templates#773):
#   1. "this repo measures the ratios" -> passive form (no repo to measure)
#   2. the detector/CATEGORIES.md citation -> "reverted upstream"
#   3. the node detector/validate.js mechanical check -> a manual prose check
#   4. the --style config path (scripts/check-style.js, examples/) -> apply, unverified
#   5. --style resolution by bare name out of examples/ -> a path only
# Each rewrite is anchored on the exact upstream text and FAILS LOUDLY if the
# anchor stops matching exactly once — so an upstream edit to one of those
# spans breaks CI here instead of silently shipping a wrong Cursor rule.
