## Best Practices

### When Using Password Lists
- Only test against systems you own or have written authorization to test
- Implement rate limiting to avoid account lockouts
- Monitor for defensive responses (WAF blocks, account locks)
- Use appropriate delays between attempts

### When Using Fuzzing Payloads
- Test in isolated environments first
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Check for secondary effects (logs, monitoring alerts)
- Document all findings systematically

### When Using Web Shells
- Only use for detection system validation
- Test in isolated lab environments
- Never deploy on production systems
- Focus on defensive detection capabilities
