# Task Creator

**Type:** L3 Worker
**Category:** 3XX Planning

Standalone-first worker for task creation. It creates tasks from an already approved plan and returns a stable summary contract.

## MANDATORY READ

Load these before execution:
- `shared/references/coordinator_summary_contract.md`
- `shared/references/environment_state_contract.md`
- `shared/references/storage_mode_detection.md`
- `shared/references/template_loading_pattern.md`
- `shared/references/creation_quality_checklist.md`
- `shared/references/destructive_operation_safety.md`

## Inputs

Core inputs:
- `taskType`
- `storyData`
- `idealPlan` or `appendMode + newTaskDescription`
- `teamId`
- `guideLinks`

Optional transport inputs:
- `runId`
- `summaryArtifactPath`

If `runId` is not provided, generate a standalone `run_id` before emitting the summary envelope.

## Output Contract

Always build a structured summary envelope:
- `schema_version`
- `summary_kind=task-plan`
- `run_id`
- `identifier`
- `producer_skill=ln-301`
- `produced_at`
- `payload`

Payload fields:
- `mode`
- `story_id`
- `task_type`
- `tasks_created`
- `tasks_updated`
- `tasks_canceled`
- `task_urls`
- `kanban_updated`
- `dry_warnings_count`
- `warnings`

If `summaryArtifactPath` is provided:
- write the same JSON summary to that path

If `summaryArtifactPath` is not provided:
- return the same summary in structured output only

## Workflow

1. Resolve task provider and template set.
2. Run DRY and destructive-operation checks where applicable.
3. Generate task documents from the selected template.
4. Validate type-specific rules.
5. Show preview and get confirmation if needed.
6. Create tasks in Linear or file mode.
7. Update kanban.
8. Return structured summary.

## Critical Rules

- Remain standalone-capable.
- Do not require coordinator runtime state.
- Keep implementation, refactoring, and test rules separated by `taskType`.
- Write machine-readable summary output every time.
- **STOP before save_issue:** verify all 7 sections present in body: Context, Implementation Plan, Technical Approach, Acceptance Criteria, Affected Components, Existing Code Impact, Definition of Done. PreToolUse hook will BLOCK creation without them.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Templates loaded
- [ ] Task documents generated
- [ ] Type-specific validation passed
- [ ] Tasks created in provider-specific storage
- [ ] kanban updated
- [ ] Structured summary returned
- [ ] Summary artifact written when `summaryArtifactPath` is provided
