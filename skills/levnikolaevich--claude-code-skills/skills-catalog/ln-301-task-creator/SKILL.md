# Task Creator

**Type:** L3 Worker
**Category:** 3XX Planning

Standalone-first worker for task creation. It creates tasks from an already approved plan and returns a stable summary contract.

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/coordinator_summary_contract.md` and `shared/references/task_plan_worker_runtime_contract.md`
**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/environment_state_contract.md`, `shared/references/storage_mode_detection.md`, `shared/references/template_loading_pattern.md`, `shared/references/creation_quality_checklist.md`, and `shared/references/destructive_operation_safety.md`

## Inputs

Core inputs:
- `taskType`
- `storyData`
- `idealPlan` — task list with scopes, AC mappings, dependencies, layer classifications
- `teamId`
- `guideLinks`

Coordinator context (passed in ADD/CREATE mode):
- `traceabilityTablePath` — materialized traceability table from coordinator Phase 2
- `discoveryContext` — architecture, tech stack, key files, integration points from coordinator Phase 1
- `tasksToCreate` — specific tasks to create (ADD mode). Worker writes the 7-section document, does not decide whether tasks are needed.

Transport inputs:
- standalone: omit `runId` and `summaryArtifactPath`
- managed: pass both `runId` and `summaryArtifactPath`

## Runtime

Runtime family: `task-plan-worker-runtime`

Phase profile:
1. `PHASE_0_CONFIG`
2. `PHASE_1_LOAD_INPUTS`
3. `PHASE_2_LOAD_CONTEXT`
4. `PHASE_3_GENERATE_TASK_DOCS`
5. `PHASE_4_VALIDATE_TASKS`
6. `PHASE_5_CONFIRM_OR_AUTOAPPROVE`
7. `PHASE_6_APPLY_CREATE`
8. `PHASE_7_UPDATE_KANBAN`
9. `PHASE_8_WRITE_SUMMARY`
10. `PHASE_9_SELF_CHECK`

Summary artifact rules:
- emit `summary_kind=task-plan`
- standalone runs generate their own `run_id` and write the default worker-family artifact path
- managed runs require both `runId` and `summaryArtifactPath` and must write the summary to the exact provided path
- always write the validated summary artifact before terminal outcome

## Output Contract

Always build a structured `task-plan` summary envelope per:
- `shared/references/coordinator_summary_contract.md`
- `shared/references/task_plan_worker_runtime_contract.md`

Payload fields:
- `mode`
- `story_id`
- `task_type`
- `tasks_created`
- `tasks_updated`
- `tasks_canceled`
- `task_urls`
- `kanban_updated`
- `dry_warnings_count`
- `warnings`

Always write the validated summary before terminal outcome.

## Workflow

1. Resolve task provider and template set.
2. Run DRY and destructive-operation checks where applicable.
3. Use coordinator context (`discoveryContext`, `traceabilityTablePath`) to understand architecture. Research codebase for implementation details (existing patterns, related files, integration points) to write good Technical Approach sections.
4. Generate task documents from the selected template.
5. Validate type-specific rules.
6. Show preview and get confirmation if needed.
7. Create tasks in Linear or file mode.
8. Update kanban.
9. Return structured summary.

## Critical Rules

- Remain standalone-capable.
- Do not require coordinator runtime state.
- Keep implementation, refactoring, and test rules separated by `taskType`.
- Write machine-readable summary output every time.
- **Ideal plan is binding.** Create every task in the approved plan. Do not re-evaluate whether tasks should exist.
- **STOP before save_issue:** verify all 7 sections present in body: Context, Implementation Plan, Technical Approach, Acceptance Criteria, Affected Components, Existing Code Impact, Definition of Done. PreToolUse hook will BLOCK creation without them.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Templates loaded
- [ ] Task documents generated
- [ ] Type-specific validation passed
- [ ] Tasks created in provider-specific storage
- [ ] kanban updated
- [ ] Structured summary returned
- [ ] Summary artifact written to the managed or standalone runtime path
