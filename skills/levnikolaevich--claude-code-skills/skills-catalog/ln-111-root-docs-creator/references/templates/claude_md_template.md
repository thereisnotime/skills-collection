## Agent Entry

- Purpose: Thin compatibility shim for Claude-compatible tooling.
- Read when: Tooling loads `CLAUDE.md` by convention or provider-specific notes are required.
- Skip when: `AGENTS.md` is already loaded.
- Canonical: No.
- Read next: `AGENTS.md`.
- Primary sources: `AGENTS.md`.

## Anthropic Notes

- Load [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as the canonical project map.
- Use the relevant canonical document from [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) before editing a domain.
- Keep this file small. Do not duplicate the full project knowledge base here.

## Maintenance

**Update Triggers:**
- When `AGENTS.md` path or purpose changes
- When Anthropic-specific notes change

**Verification:**
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` link resolves
- [ ] No duplicated large guidance block was added here
- [ ] Provider-specific notes are still accurate
