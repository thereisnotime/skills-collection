# Story Quality Gate

Runtime-backed gate coordinator. Owns fast-track routing, quality/test summaries, final Story verdict, and branch finalization.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `storyId` | Yes | args, git branch, kanban, user | Story to process |

**Resolution:** Story Resolution Chain.  
**Status filter:** To Review

## Purpose & Scope

- Invoke `ln-510-quality-coordinator`
- Invoke `ln-520-test-planner` when needed
- Wait deterministically for test-task readiness
- Calculate gate verdict: `PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED`
- Move Story to `Done` only on passing outcomes
- Persist resumable gate runtime in `.hex-skills/story-gate/runtime/`

## 4-Level Gate Model

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `PASS` | All checks passed | Story -> `Done` |
| `CONCERNS` | Minor issues, accepted risk | Story -> `Done` with comment |
| `FAIL` | Blocking issues found | Create follow-up tasks; Story does not go to `Done` |
| `WAIVED` | User-approved exception | Story -> `Done` with waiver evidence |

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Config

1. Resolve `storyId` and `task_provider`.
2. Build gate manifest:
   - `story_id`
   - `task_provider`
   - `project_root`
   - `worktree_dir`
   - `branch`
   - `fast_track_policy`
   - `nfr_policy`
   - `test_task_policy`
3. Start runtime and checkpoint `PHASE_0_CONFIG`.

### Phase 1: Discovery

1. Load Story metadata and child task metadata.
2. Detect existing test task and its current status.
3. Capture readiness inputs if available from upstream pipeline.
4. Checkpoint `PHASE_1_DISCOVERY`.

### Phase 2: Fast-Track

1. Determine `fast_track=true` only when readiness explicitly allows it.
2. Checkpoint `PHASE_2_FAST_TRACK` with:
   - `fast_track`
   - gate scope summary

### Phase 3: Quality Checks

1. Invoke `ln-510-quality-coordinator`:
   - full mode: `Skill(skill: "ln-510-quality-coordinator", args: "{storyId}")`
   - fast-track: `Skill(skill: "ln-510-quality-coordinator", args: "{storyId} --fast-track")`
2. Read `.hex-skills/runtime-artifacts/runs/{run_id}/story-quality/{story_id}.json`.
3. Record the summary with `record-quality`.
4. Checkpoint `PHASE_3_QUALITY_CHECKS`.
5. If the quality summary already implies hard FAIL, you may jump directly to `PHASE_6_VERDICT`.

### Phase 4: Test Planning

1. Decide whether planning is needed:
   - no test task -> invoke `ln-520`
   - fast-track -> invoke simplified `ln-520`
   - test task already exists and is terminal (`Done | SKIPPED | VERIFIED`) -> checkpoint as reused
2. Read `.hex-skills/runtime-artifacts/runs/{run_id}/story-tests/{story_id}.json`.
3. Record test planner result with `record-test-status`.
4. Checkpoint `PHASE_4_TEST_PLANNING`.

### Phase 5: Test Verification

1. If test task exists but is not `Done`, pause runtime:
   - `phase = PAUSED`
   - `resume_action = wait for test task completion`
2. When resumed, verify:
   - test task terminal status is `Done`, `SKIPPED`, or `VERIFIED`
   - coverage summary exists
   - planned scenarios and Story AC coverage are machine-readable
3. Checkpoint `PHASE_5_TEST_VERIFICATION` with:
   - `test_task_status`
   - verification result

### Phase 6: Verdict

1. Calculate `quality_score`.
2. Evaluate NFR validation:
   - full gate: security, performance, reliability, maintainability
   - fast-track: security mandatory, others may downgrade to concerns-only scope
3. Determine final verdict.
4. For `FAIL`:
   - create follow-up tasks
   - keep Story out of `Done`
5. Checkpoint `PHASE_6_VERDICT` with:
   - `final_result`
   - `quality_score`
   - `nfr_validation`
   - `fix_tasks_created`

### Phase 7: Finalization

For `PASS | CONCERNS | WAIVED`:

1. Commit and push verified branch if needed.
2. Move Story to `Done`.
3. Post gate comment.
4. Cleanup worktree when caller does not own it.

For `FAIL`:

1. Do not finalize branch as accepted.
2. Checkpoint `PHASE_7_FINALIZATION` with `status=skipped_by_verdict`.
3. Record resulting Story status and follow-up task IDs.

### Phase 8: Self-Check

Build final checklist from runtime state:

- [ ] Config, discovery, and fast-track checkpoints exist
- [ ] Quality summary recorded from `ln-510`
- [ ] Test-planning and test-verification state are deterministic
- [ ] Final verdict checkpoint exists
- [ ] Story final status recorded
- [ ] Branch finalization recorded or skipped by verdict

Checkpoint `PHASE_8_SELF_CHECK` with `pass=true|false`.
Complete runtime only after `pass=true`.

## Worker Invocation (MANDATORY)

| Phase | Worker | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 3 | `ln-510-quality-coordinator` | Code quality, agent review, regression, log analysis |
| 4 | `ln-520-test-planner` | Research/manual/auto test planning |

```javascript
Skill(skill: "ln-510-quality-coordinator", args: "{storyId}")
Skill(skill: "ln-520-test-planner", args: "{storyId}")
```

## TodoWrite format (mandatory)

```
- Start ln-500 runtime (pending)
- Load Story/test-task metadata (pending)
- Decide fast-track mode (pending)
- Invoke ln-510 and record quality summary (pending)
- Invoke or reuse ln-520 and record test-planning summary (pending)
- Verify test task readiness (pending)
- Calculate final verdict (pending)
- Finalize Story/branch state (pending)
- Run runtime self-check and complete (pending)
```

## Critical Rules

- Runtime state is the gate orchestration SSOT.
- `ln-510` and `ln-520` are consumed only through summary JSON artifacts.
- Test-task waiting is a deterministic pause, not an implicit stop.
- `FAIL` is a valid terminal gate result if follow-up actions are recorded correctly.
- Story may go to `Done` only on `PASS`, `CONCERNS`, or `WAIVED`.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Runtime started and config/discovery checkpoints recorded
- [ ] Fast-track decision checkpointed
- [ ] `ln-510` summary recorded in runtime
- [ ] `ln-520` summary recorded or reused deterministically
- [ ] Test verification reached terminal state or deterministic pause
- [ ] Final verdict checkpointed with quality score and NFR results
- [ ] Story moved to `Done` only for passing outcomes, or follow-up tasks created for `FAIL`
- [ ] Self-check passed and runtime completed

## Phase 9: Meta-Analysis

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/meta_analysis_protocol.md`

Skill type: `execution-orchestrator`. Run after phases complete. Output to chat using the `execution-orchestrator` format.
