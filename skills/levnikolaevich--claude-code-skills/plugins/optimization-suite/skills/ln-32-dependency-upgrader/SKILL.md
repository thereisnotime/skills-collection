# Dependency Upgrader

**Goal:** Upgrade dependencies in small, attributable batches. Preserve manifests, lockfiles, runtime support, and product behavior; do not treat a newer version as valuable without compatibility, security, or maintenance evidence.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred tool | Use it when | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Package-manager detection | Manifests, lockfiles, workspace files, runtime files, and repository instructions | Always before choosing commands or update scope | Build and CI configuration |
| Outdated and vulnerable packages | Native package-manager outdated and audit commands | The manager and registry are available | Official registry, vendor advisory, and lockfile inspection |
| Breaking changes and support | Official release notes, migration guides, changelogs, advisories, and runtime support tables | Every consequential minor, major, replacement, or security update | Primary-source repository releases; otherwise mark `UNVERIFIED` |
| Usage and blast radius | Language server or host-native code intelligence | An updated API, type, plugin, build tool, or runtime may affect consumers | Targeted import, symbol, configuration, and script search |
| Safe version changes | Native package-manager commands | Updating manifests and generated lock state | Do not hand-edit lockfiles or emulate package resolution |
| Verification | Repository-defined install, restore, build, lint, type, test, migration, and smoke commands | Before changes and after each batch | CI and script inspection with explicit unverified status |
| Diff and rollback | Git status, diff, and isolated commits or worktree | Protecting user changes and reverting only the failed batch | Stop if the batch cannot be isolated safely |

Never publish packages, rotate credentials, deploy, or weaken audit and verification gates. Do not run lifecycle scripts from an untrusted package source without the environment's normal safeguards.

## Evidence Rules

- Manifests declare constraints and lockfiles record resolved versions; install metadata proves the active environment when it differs. Registry "latest" does not override runtime or compatibility constraints.
- A vulnerability finding requires the affected version, advisory, reachability or exposure context, and a credible remediation.
- A breaking-change claim requires release or migration evidence matching the exact version transition.
- Keep generated lockfile changes only when produced by the selected native package manager and expected repository version.
- Upgrade success requires repository verification, not only a successful install or restore.

## Checklist

### 1. Discover Scope and Protect the Workspace

- [ ] Detect package managers, manifests, locks, registries, runtime/tool pins, generated state, and dependency-linked workspaces within the requested update scope; expand only for demonstrated compatibility dependencies.
- [ ] Classify each deliverable as an application, library, plugin, CLI, container, or build tool so version ranges, lockfiles, peer constraints, and supported-runtime promises are interpreted correctly.
- [ ] Read repository instructions and determine supported package-manager versions, update commands, lockfile policy, and CI expectations.
- [ ] Inspect Git state and isolate the work so existing user changes cannot be overwritten or mistaken for upgrade output.
- [ ] Start a run-owned resource ledger with every created absolute path, worktree, process ID, cache, report, and temporary artifact; never register pre-existing resources as cleanup targets.
- [ ] Resolve the requested scope: security-only, routine patch or minor maintenance, selected packages, majors, runtime migration, or complete refresh.
- [ ] Capture install or restore, build, lint, type, test, smoke, and security-audit baseline before editing.
- [ ] Record pre-existing failures, advisories, deprecations, peer conflicts, and unsupported runtime combinations.

### 2. Research and Plan Batches

- [ ] Use native outdated and audit commands to inventory direct and relevant transitive updates without changing files.
- [ ] Separate removals, security fixes, routine updates, major changes, build-tool changes, and runtime or ecosystem migrations.
- [ ] Check official release notes and migration guides for API changes, configuration changes, defaults, peer constraints, runtime support, and removed behavior.
- [ ] Resolve environment markers, extras, optional/dev groups, peer dependencies, target frameworks, and platform-specific packages; a graph that resolves only on the current machine is not sufficient when the project promises a wider matrix.
- [ ] Check official advisories for affected ranges, exploit conditions, fixed versions, workarounds, and whether the dependency is reachable in this project.
- [ ] Search actual imports, symbols, plugins, scripts, configuration, generated code, and runtime loading for every consequential dependency.
- [ ] Identify unused, duplicate, abandoned, replaced, or platform-redundant dependencies as separate removal candidates; require runtime and dynamic-loading evidence, and explicit user approval when removal is outside the requested upgrade scope.
- [ ] Order batches by the actual compatibility graph; package manager/runtime, tooling, foundational libraries, framework, integrations, and leaves are a discovery guide, not a fixed sequence. Combine mutually dependent transitions.
- [ ] Keep routine batches small enough to attribute failure; batch framework families, analyzers, generated clients, or tightly constrained peers together only when their compatibility matrix requires it.
- [ ] Stop for user direction when mutually exclusive version strategies, runtime support, licensing, registry policy, or migration scope changes product intent.

### 3. Apply Each Batch Safely

- [ ] Use the native package manager to update manifests and lockfiles with the repository's expected version and flags.
- [ ] Avoid broad re-resolution when the request is narrow unless the manager cannot preserve the lock graph safely; explain unavoidable churn.
- [ ] Inspect install scripts, registry source, checksums, package provenance, and unexpected new transitive packages when security risk warrants it.
- [ ] Update imports, APIs, types, configuration, build scripts, plugins, generated clients, and application code required by documented breaking changes.
- [ ] Update user or operator documentation only when accepted behavior, prerequisites, configuration, or commands change.
- [ ] Inspect the diff immediately for unrelated formatting, deleted constraints, registry drift, line-ending churn, generated artifacts, and accidental downgrades.
- [ ] Inspect the resolved graph for newly duplicated major versions, unsatisfied or silently ignored peers, changed optional features, and transitive substitutions that alter runtime behavior.
- [ ] Do not suppress warnings, disable audits, skip required checks, pin incompatible peers forcibly, or add compatibility hacks without evidence.

### 4. Verify and Keep or Revert

- [ ] Run install or restore from a clean-enough state to prove lockfile reproducibility.
- [ ] Run the relevant build, lint, type, unit, integration, smoke, packaging, migration, and application-start checks after each batch.
- [ ] Classify affected runtime, target-framework, OS, architecture, and feature combinations as required or optional; retain a batch only with local or trusted CI evidence for every required cell, and return `BLOCKED` when required coverage has no credible fallback.
- [ ] Exercise changed APIs, plugins, serializers, build outputs, and runtime paths that generic tests may not cover.
- [ ] Compare bundle, startup, artifact, or performance metrics when the updated dependency can materially change them.
- [ ] Re-run the security audit and distinguish fixed, remaining, newly introduced, unreachable, and no-fix advisories.
- [ ] Keep the batch only when verification passes and expected behavior remains supported.
- [ ] For a failed batch, distinguish baseline or environment failures from upgrade defects; repair bounded migration errors and recheck, or revert the entire batch without touching user work. Record the blocker and continue only with independent safe batches.
- [ ] Establish the retained dependency state as the baseline before applying the next batch.
- [ ] Classify each planned batch as `KEPT` when applied and verified, `REVERTED` when applied then fully rolled back after failed verification, or `SKIPPED` when deliberately not applied because a required decision, compatibility strategy, or independent prerequisite is unresolved.

### 5. Finalize and Report

- [ ] Confirm all required repository verification covers the combined retained state. Reuse still-valid results; run missing checks and rerun those invalidated by later batches or unresolved failures.
- [ ] Confirm manifests, lockfiles, runtime pins, CI, containers, documentation, and generated metadata agree on the final versions.
- [ ] Remove only run-owned ledger entries: verify absolute paths remain inside approved temporary roots, stop exact recorded process IDs, preserve dirty or pre-existing worktrees, and retain evidence artifacts intentionally reported.
- [ ] List intentionally skipped packages with exact constraint, risk, advisory, or migration reason.
- [ ] Reconcile the batch ledger with final versions, migration edits, advisories, lockfile churn, and residual risks.
- [ ] Use `UPDATED` only when the requested update scope is satisfied and verified; `PARTIAL` when a safe subset is retained but requested work or optional coverage remains; `NO_CHANGE` when no batch is retained and baseline is restored; `BLOCKED` when safe progress or required verification is unavailable.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Managers, workspaces, runtimes, requested update policy, and pre-existing failures/advisories. Per batch: packages, versions, migrations, `KEPT / REVERTED / SKIPPED`, and verification. Include fixed/remaining/new advisories, peer/runtime/registry constraints, lockfile churn, skipped-package reasons, combined-state checks, run-owned manifest/lockfile/diff and rollback/cleanup evidence.
