# Delivery Reviewer

**Goal:** Review only the requested delivery change and the causal paths needed to prove its business outcome. Judge scoped acceptance and release safety with concise evidence; do not audit unrelated code, repair findings, update trackers, or widen scope.

**Execution contract:** Treat the ordered checkbox workflow below as this skill's Definition of Done. Work through every item in order, and mark it complete only when its action and required evidence are complete. `N/A`, skipped, unavailable, or delegated items remain incomplete.
Before returning, apply this skill's verdict, decision, and approval rules to every incomplete item and prepend **Checklist: X/Y complete**<br>**Incomplete: None | section/item — reason; outcome impact; exact next action**; list every incomplete item.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred capability | Use when | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope and repository state | Native file reads plus Git | Establishing outcome, non-goals, base, head, and worktree | Supplied requirements with explicit limitations |
| Changed behavior | Diff, status, and focused reads | Resolving the implementation delta and entrypoints | Compare supplied artifacts with their stated baseline |
| Definitions and consumers | Code intelligence | An affected path depends on unchanged symbols or contracts | Targeted search that stops when the causal path is proven |
| Automated verification | Repository-defined commands | Build, lint, type, test, migration, or smoke gates exist | Inspect scripts and CI; mark execution `UNPROVEN` |
| Observable behavior | Browser, client, or runtime evidence | Acceptance depends on UI, interaction, protocol, or logs | Static trace plus an exact manual check |
| External contracts | Current official documentation or specifications | A changing external fact can alter correctness or severity | Primary-source research; otherwise mark `UNVERIFIED` |
| Independent review | Native subagents in separate contexts | Initial code-bearing review; optional on follow-up | Run blind waves within host limits; return `BLOCKED` only when required initial independence remains impossible |

Use tools only for the current evidence question. Tool failure is a limitation, not a defect. Do not convert an unavailable command, runtime, or source into a finding without implementation evidence.

## Evidence Rules

| Evidence | Weight |
|---|---|
| Reproduced behavior, failing test, compiler output, or deterministic command | Strongest current-behavior evidence |
| Changed code plus verified caller, consumer, schema, or configuration path | Strong static evidence |
| Acceptance criterion mapped to implementation and verification | Required delivery evidence |
| Official external contract matching the used version | Strong compatibility evidence |
| Pattern, intuition, or generic practice | Lead only until tied to a concrete failure or risk |

Every finding must name the affected business behavior, change-causal path, violated contract, evidence, impact, and smallest credible correction. The review unit is the business change, not the repository. Read unchanged code only to prove an affected path; do not report style preferences or unrelated repository health.

## Independent Review Panel

Use Six Thinking Hats as evidence lenses, not personalities. The Blue lead scopes the review, selects agents, verifies claims, resolves conflicts, and issues the verdict.

On the first completed-delivery review for an authoritative task, always spawn White, Black, Green, and Tests and oracles. Stop there for small low-risk work; add one or two distinct hats for medium risk; run all five non-Blue hats for high-risk, architectural, cross-service, unfamiliar, or ambiguous work. Add up to three other specialists only for risks activated by the change: four to nine subagents plus the Blue lead. Treat a review as first when no completed prior report proves the reviewed base, head, scope, and panel, or when the task, scope, or baseline materially changed.
On a follow-up review of the same task and scope, no hat or specialist is mandatory. The Blue lead may select any non-duplicative subset or none from the new diff, unresolved findings, unproven evidence, and changed risks; record the rationale and never rerun a lens only because it ran before. Apply the same risk-based freedom to non-code delivery and record `Independent review panel: None` when no lens adds value.

| Hat | Question |
|---|---|
| White — facts | What changed, which outcome and paths are affected, and what scoped evidence is missing? |
| Red — human response | What will surprise or mislead a user, developer, reviewer, or operator? Treat intuition as a hypothesis. |
| Black — caution | How can the change regress, corrupt state, breach trust, or fail at edges and partial failure? |
| Yellow — value | Which intended value, compatibility, and sound tradeoffs must be preserved; which concerns are false positives? |
| Green — surgical simplicity | AI slop is prohibited. Is this the smallest sufficient diff and simplest efficient algorithm for the evidenced need without sacrificing safety, clarity, testability, or operability? |

| Specialist | Trigger | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Security and privacy | Trust boundaries, untrusted input, secrets, sensitive data, destructive action | Guards, isolation, recovery, and sensitive-data flow |
| Data and concurrency | Schemas, transactions, queues, caches, events, async work, locks | Atomicity, races, ordering, duplicates, wiring, and orphan channels |
| API and compatibility | Public interfaces, protocols, serialization, configuration, mixed versions | Producers, consumers, removals, and supported compatibility |
| Architecture and migration | Approved design, replacement, refactor, cutover, or deprecation | Plan traceability, target completeness, old paths, and unmigrated callers |
| Tests and oracles | Initial code-bearing review; follow-up when test risk warrants | Material business risks, trustworthy oracles, E2E-first coverage, and removal or consolidation of low-value tests |
| Performance and reliability | Hot paths, I/O, retries, timeouts, load, resource ownership | Amplification, measurement, leaks, storms, and degradation |
| UI and accessibility | Rendering, interaction, responsive state, localization | Keyboard, focus, names, motion, copy, and rendered behavior |
| Operations and release | Deployment, configuration, observability, rollback, recovery | Safe rollout, useful signals, and recovery steps |

On an initial code-bearing review, always select Tests and oracles and choose up to three other specialists by impact, likelihood, and rollback difficulty. On follow-up, every specialist is optional; choose freely from current evidence, avoid duplicate questions, and record selection, omission, or merge reasons.

Give each subagent the same frozen packet: authoritative task, required plan items, business thesis, acceptance criteria, maturity evidence, base and head, changed/supporting/excluded scope, non-goals, approved approach, repository instructions, risk class, and allowed commands. Add exactly one lens, read-only and scope boundaries, and the result schema. Do not include provisional or sibling findings.

Run agents in parallel or blind waves. Allow read, search, code intelligence, official-source research, and non-mutating verification; forbid tracked edits, commits, pushes, deployments, external writes, and nested subagents. Retry a failed critical lens once only when a concrete cause changes. Wait for all selected lenses; resolve material conflicts through direct evidence or one bounded verifier.

Each subagent returns coverage, candidate findings with change-causal evidence and smallest correction, rejected hypotheses that resolve material ambiguity, and open questions. `No findings` is valid; never manufacture comments to justify a lens.

## Checklist

### 1. Establish Business and Change Scope

- [ ] Before reading implementation detail, state the affected actors, problem, protected outcome, changed behavior, acceptance criteria, invariants, non-goals, and release boundary. Mark unsupported interpretations `UNKNOWN`; use `BLOCKED` when the thesis cannot be established.
- [ ] Establish complexity fit from evidenced maturity, business horizon, scale, team capacity, and lifecycle cost; do not infer enterprise needs from hypothetical growth or call safety-required complexity overengineering.
- [ ] Read applicable repository instructions, inspect uncommitted work, and resolve the authoritative task, base, head, implementation delta, approved plan or target architecture, and permitted transitional compatibility.
- [ ] Discover only change-relevant baseline, current-state, target-design, decision, diagram, and migration artifacts by repository convention; record status and freshness without requiring a particular path.
- [ ] Map changed, causally supporting, and explicitly excluded surfaces. Read outside the diff only to trace affected behavior; do not hunt unrelated code for findings.
- [ ] Classify change-triggered risk from trust, money, destructive action, migration, public contracts, concurrency, distributed coordination, and rollback difficulty; define acceptance evidence before implementation review.
- [ ] Classify the pass as first or follow-up from a completed prior report and stable task, scope, and baseline; freeze the thesis and scope. For a first code-bearing review, select White, Black, Green, and Tests and oracles plus only risk-triggered lenses. For follow-up or non-code delivery, let the Blue lead select any useful subset or `None` and record why; keep preliminary conclusions private.
- [ ] Keep the review read-only. Permit only host-approved caches or build artifacts; do not edit tracked files, create tasks, commit, push, deploy, or repair findings.

### 2. Trace Requirements into Implementation

- [ ] Enumerate every authoritative task requirement and acceptance criterion, plus every required approved-plan item. Map each to concrete implementation and independent behavioral evidence; mark task and plan items `COMPLETE`, `DEVIATED`, `OMITTED`, or `UNPROVEN` and acceptance `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `UNPROVEN`. Author claims, checked boxes, commits, and code presence are not completion evidence.
- [ ] Inspect changed files and only the unchanged definitions, consumers, interfaces, tests, migrations, and registration needed to prove an affected path.
- [ ] Verify the change serves the protected outcome, including first meaningful use, material failure, recovery, and repetition where relevant.
- [ ] Verify each required plan item was implemented and works in its intended runtime path. Treat unexplained omissions as unmet; accept `DEVIATED` only when explicit evidence proves the alternative fully preserves the task, protected outcome, constraints, and acceptance. Distinguish justified deviation from stale or proposed documentation.
- [ ] Trace each critical scenario from actor trigger through entrypoint, runtime wiring, usage context, and observable outcome.
- [ ] Confirm new components, routes, commands, handlers, jobs, events, and configuration are registered and discoverable at runtime.
- [ ] Within affected behavior, inspect applicable boundaries, collections, state transitions, duplicates, ordering, numeric behavior, empty and maximum inputs, errors, retries, idempotency, cancellation, timeouts, rollback, and cleanup.
- [ ] Within affected async paths, inspect shared state, transactions, races, lock ordering, and blocking work.

### 3. Review Safety, Contracts, and Simplicity

- [ ] Within affected paths, inspect applicable authentication, authorization, ownership, validation, injection, secrets, sensitive data, logging, and destructive-operation guards.
- [ ] For changed destructive behavior, require recovery, rollback, blast-radius, environment or authorization, and preview or dry-run evidence; justify infeasible controls.
- [ ] Verify changed API, event, schema, configuration, serialization, and storage producers and consumers, including names, payloads, registration, ordering, and compatibility.
- [ ] Verify migrations, backfills, defaults, indexes, deployment ordering, and mixed-version behavior when persisted or distributed state changes.
- [ ] Check ownership and cleanup of files, streams, sessions, connections, processes, subscriptions, and temporary artifacts on success and failure.
- [ ] Inspect only architecture boundaries crossed or changed; match complexity to evidenced need without turning adjacent architecture into an audit.
- [ ] When code is replaced, verify old implementations, signatures, aliases, re-exports, shims, adapters, flags, dual paths, and files are removed and callers migrated. Retain compatibility only for a supported contract with an owner and bounded removal condition.
- [ ] Run a subtractive pass for changed logic, constraints, configuration, schemas, routes, states, and operations. Record obsolete candidates, proven removals, and retention evidence; use `one in, two out` only as a prompt, never a deletion quota.
- [ ] **KISS:** AI slop is prohibited. Require the minimum sufficient diff and simplest correct, efficient algorithm. Reject needless duplication, files, layers, abstractions, dependencies, configuration, branches, compatibility paths, or custom machinery when existing mechanisms suffice; never trade away safeguards or maintainability.
- [ ] Derive each correction from scoped repository evidence, preferring an existing mechanism. For external APIs, libraries, security controls, protocols, platforms, standards, or versions, verify the solution in current official version-matched documentation; use primary engineering sources only for unresolved consequential tradeoffs.
- [ ] Record correction sources, dates, verified claims, alternatives, and why the choice is the smallest safe fit. Review never authorizes repair; a later implementer must revalidate unstable external facts.

### 4. Verify Tests, Documentation, and Operations

- [ ] Before recommending or retaining any test, rank the changed business scenario by failure likelihood, user or operational impact, blast radius, reversibility, and regression history. Cover only material risks; reject test count, line coverage, and tests for trivial or low-risk behavior as goals.
- [ ] Prohibit tests whose oracle merely re-proves language or standard-library behavior, default framework routing, validation, or lifecycle, external-package behavior, uncustomized ORM or driver mechanics, database-vendor capability, getters, pass-through wrappers, or other trivial implementation. Crossing a real dependency is valid only when it proves a repository-owned business rule, configuration, runtime registration, integration contract, query, schema, permission, transaction, recovery path, or user journey.
- [ ] Prefer deterministic E2E tests through the user-observable boundary for every material business risk. Require an explicit reason for integration or contract coverage instead. Permit a unit test only when it isolates material repository-owned business logic and evidence shows broader coverage would be less deterministic, precise, or useful; without that recorded justification, assign `DELETE` or `MERGE`.
- [ ] Classify every affected test as `KEEP`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`; verify business-risk linkage, defect sensitivity, oracle strength, assertions, success and failure paths, authorization, boundaries, data integrity, over-mocking, snapshots, flakes, shared state, time, randomness, and order dependence.
- [ ] Assign `DELETE` to every test that covers only forbidden or trivial logic, an obsolete contract, an implementation detail, duplicate behavior, or immaterial risk. Assign `MERGE` when its unique valuable assertion can be absorbed into a risk-focused E2E, integration, or contract test; never `KEEP` or `UPDATE` a nonconforming test.
- [ ] Discover commands from repository docs, tool configuration, and manifests before justified fallback. Run narrow checks first, then required build, lint, type, test, migration, and smoke gates with CI-safe options.
- [ ] Record command source, exit status, relevant output, and limitations. Attribute failures to the change or baseline; a missing environment or pre-existing failure is `UNPROVEN` unless causally linked.
- [ ] Verify user-visible acceptance from the other side when static proof is insufficient, including material failure and recovery; for applicable UI, check keyboard, focus, accessible names, motion, responsive states, copy, and localization.
- [ ] Review only documentation and comments changed by or required for the scoped business change; classify each as `KEEP`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`. Delete or merge only when canonical coverage preserves every needed audience task and contract.
- [ ] Enforce documentation SSOT and hierarchy: update the narrowest canonical owner, link instead of copying rules, avoid a new document when an existing owner fits, and remove superseded references without auditing unrelated documentation.
- [ ] Reject documentation AI slop: filler, repeated summaries, speculation, or implementation and business-logic restatement. Keep concise audience-needed intent, contracts, actions, and constraints; allow only minimal verified code or command examples needed to act.
- [ ] Keep volatile versions, paths, defaults, counts, commands, generated output, and current-state data in authoritative code, configuration, or generated sources where practical. Otherwise require the source, scope, and owner or generation/update trigger.
- [ ] Verify affected API and configuration references, examples, migrations, runbooks, operator steps, and comments against implementation and requirements; comments explain enduring intent or constraints rather than syntax.
- [ ] Check logs, metrics, traces, health signals, feature controls, deployment order, rollback, and recovery where the change creates operational risk.

### 5. Challenge and Synthesize

- [ ] Launch all selected lenses in separate contexts with the frozen packet, one primary question, read-only tools, and the required schema; keep them blind, wait for all, and record failures or retries.
- [ ] Verify each candidate against code, commands, behavior, declared intent, or authoritative documentation; trace symptom to causal path and violated contract, and reject subjective or symptom-only claims.
- [ ] Accept a finding only when the diff introduced, exposed, or worsened it; it violates scoped acceptance; or the change caused a required-gate failure. Treat other issues only as limitations when they block acceptance; never recommend their repair.
- [ ] Deduplicate by root cause, preserve the strongest evidence and widest demonstrated impact, and recommend one smallest sufficient correction.
- [ ] Resolve contradictions by tracing behavior; use one bounded verifier only when direct inspection cannot settle the claim.
- [ ] Classify findings `P0` catastrophic, `P1` release-blocking, `P2` important non-blocking, or `P3` minor actionable.
- [ ] Use `FAIL` for unresolved `P0/P1`, a required task or plan item that is `OMITTED` or demonstrably incorrect, unmet acceptance, a change-caused required-gate failure, or demonstrated unsafe high-risk behavior. Use `CONCERNS` only for explicit non-blocking risk. Use `PASS` only when every required task and plan item is `COMPLETE` or evidence-backed `DEVIATED`, every acceptance criterion passes, and all required evidence is complete.
- [ ] Use `BLOCKED` when a required task or plan item remains `UNPROVEN`, or a required lens, specialist, safety environment, authoritative contract, or acceptance prerequisite has no credible replacement; report the coverage gap, not a product defect.
- [ ] Return only scope, panel coverage, acceptance evidence, test and documentation actions, findings, commands, limitations, verdict rationale, and residual risk. Omit passed-area narration and repeated context; collapse empty sections to `None`.
