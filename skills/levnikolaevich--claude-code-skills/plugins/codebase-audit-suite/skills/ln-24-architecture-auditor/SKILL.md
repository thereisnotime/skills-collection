# Architecture Auditor

**Goal:** Perform a read-only audit of the architecture the system actually executes. Evaluate whether structure, dependencies, contracts, and cross-component ownership fit current product needs without rewarding pattern names or speculative modernization. Judge where atomicity and resource ownership belong; leave local query, transaction, and data-resource correctness to a persistence-focused review.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred tool | Use it when | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Physical and declared architecture | Native file listing, manifests, build files, configuration, and architecture documents | Establishing modules, packages, domains, layers, entrypoints, and deployment units | Targeted repository map from known entrypoints |
| Symbols and dependency topology | Language server, compiler metadata, or host-native code intelligence | Tracing imports, calls, implementations, routes, events, and cycles | Narrow search plus direct inspection of definitions and consumers |
| Runtime wiring | Registration code, dependency injection, routing, startup configuration, and safe runtime diagnostics | A component may exist but not be discoverable or connected | Static trace with explicit uncertainty |
| Historical intent | Git history, blame, and decision records | A current exception or parallel mechanism may have a still-valid reason | Current behavior and documented constraints remain authoritative |
| Architectural fitness | Current official framework and platform documentation | A finding depends on supported extension, lifecycle, configuration, or boundary behavior | Primary-source web research; otherwise mark `UNVERIFIED` |
| Quantitative structure | Existing dependency, cycle, complexity, or package-analysis commands | The repository already defines reliable structural analysis | Reproducible static inventory and call-path evidence |

Use diagrams only when they clarify a relationship that prose cannot. Do not generate a diagram as a substitute for evidence, and do not modify code or architecture documents during the audit.

## Evidence Rules

- Executable dependencies, runtime wiring, and public contracts outweigh intended diagrams or folder names.
- A cycle or cross-layer call is a finding only when it creates a concrete change, ownership, testing, deployment, or failure cost.
- Pattern compliance is not a goal by itself; evaluate fitness against product complexity, team workflow, and operational constraints.
- Framework convention and generated wiring require framework-aware verification before being labeled leakage or dead code.
- Modernization is justified only by a present defect or measurable simplification, not novelty.
- Explicit repository boundary rules define intended constraints; documentation explains them; inference from folder names is low-confidence evidence and must not create a violation by itself.
- A prior audit baseline separates new, resolved, and accepted debt. It does not make an active correctness or security risk disappear.
- Shared system-design baseline, current-state, target-design, decision, diagram, and migration artifacts are optional intent evidence. Their absence is not a defect by itself, and their presence never outranks executable behavior for the implemented state.

## Checklist

### 1. Discover the Actual Architecture

- [ ] Read repository instructions, architecture documents, manifests, entrypoints, deployment definitions, and configuration ownership rules.
- [ ] Discover shared architecture artifacts by repository convention, distinguish a system-design baseline from a prior audit baseline, and classify each as current, proposed, accepted, superseded, stale, contradictory, or `UNKNOWN`; do not require any particular artifact path.
- [ ] Map packages, modules, domains, layers, processes, data stores, queues, external systems, and public interfaces in scope.
- [ ] Record ownership and independent build, deploy, scale, and failure boundaries; do not infer a service boundary from a directory or process name alone.
- [ ] Identify the dominant organizing model and any competing models: layer-first, domain-first, service boundaries, plugin boundaries, or framework conventions.
- [ ] Trace representative critical flows from entrypoint through orchestration, domain behavior, persistence or integration, and observable outcome.
- [ ] Compare documented current state, target state, accepted decisions, and active migration phase with executable structure; record drift and authority conflicts without assuming documentation describes what actually runs.
- [ ] Inspect Git state so current work and unrelated user changes are not misclassified as established architecture.
- [ ] Keep the audit read-only and disclose any permitted diagnostic caches or generated analysis artifacts.

### 2. Audit Pattern Fitness and Ownership

- [ ] Identify major patterns from behavior and assess problem fit, completeness, consistency, and evidenced maintenance cost; avoid invented numeric scores.
- [ ] Check whether abstractions remove real volatility or merely move straightforward code behind interfaces, factories, registries, or generic layers.
- [ ] Check layer direction, domain ownership, orchestration depth, side-effect boundaries, and whether policy remains separated from infrastructure detail.
- [ ] Trace where cross-component transactions, sessions, connections, streams, processes, subscriptions, and background work are owned; report boundary ambiguity without duplicating local lifecycle or transaction-correctness analysis.
- [ ] For each state-changing critical flow, identify the atomicity owner and how partial failure is prevented, retried idempotently, or compensated across stores and messages.
- [ ] Check read-named or pure-looking interfaces for hidden writes, broad side effects, network calls, or lifecycle ownership that violates their contract.
- [ ] Find parallel architectural mechanisms, partially completed migrations, compatibility paths with no consumer, and extension points with no credible variation.
- [ ] Check whether failure handling and retries sit at the layer that owns the operation rather than being duplicated or swallowed across layers.

### 3. Audit Contracts and Dependencies

- [ ] Inspect public API, service, event, command, and persistence boundaries for stable input/output models plus explicit error, nullability, idempotency, and compatibility contracts.
- [ ] Check whether shared entity or framework types, missing boundary models, boolean modes, excessive parameters, unstable serialization, or naming drift create coupling or contract ambiguity; do not demand DTOs where a shared model is an intentional stable contract.
- [ ] Build module or package dependency direction using resolved internal edges; account for aliases, re-exports, generated code, reflection, registries, plugins, and runtime loading before declaring an edge absent.
- [ ] Apply configured forbidden/allowed dependency rules first; if rules are only inferred, report the inferred model and confidence instead of presenting it as policy.
- [ ] Identify forbidden imports, cycles, unstable dependency direction, excessive fan-in/fan-out, and isolated islands; use structural metrics to locate candidates, then apply the consequence check below.
- [ ] Trace cycle and coupling findings to concrete effects on change radius, initialization, testing, deployment, ownership, or failure propagation.
- [ ] Check that producers and consumers agree on event names, schemas, versions, delivery semantics, ordering, and registration.
- [ ] Check physical structure for domain cohesion, framework placement, junk drawers, duplicate module roots, orphan packages, and files whose location hides ownership.
- [ ] Check configuration boundaries for typed settings, composition-root ownership, precedence and override semantics, startup validation, scattered environment reads, secret ownership, and leakage into domain behavior.
- [ ] Verify runtime discovery: routes, handlers, jobs, commands, plugins, middleware, serializers, and dependency bindings must be registered and reachable.

### 4. Evaluate Evolution and Alternatives

- [ ] Identify current architecture pain using repository evidence: repeated change sets, fragile tests, broad blast radius, duplicate mechanisms, release coupling, or incident-prone ownership.
- [ ] If a system-design baseline exists, verify its source and freshness, then compare confirmed constraints with actual behavior.
- [ ] If a prior audit baseline exists, compare new, resolved, and retained findings; continue to report accepted or retained risks when their impact remains material.
- [ ] Research external pattern or framework behavior only when it can confirm a capability, limitation, lifecycle rule, or supported simplification.
- [ ] Compare the current shape with the simplest credible alternative, including migration risk, compatibility, rollback, team impact, and operational cost.
- [ ] Prefer incremental boundary repair when a rewrite or new pattern would create more transitional complexity than it removes.
- [ ] Reject recommendations that require speculative scale, unsupported future variants, or replacement of working conventions without a demonstrated defect.
- [ ] Include a migration sequence only when the recommendation cannot be applied safely as one bounded change.

### 5. Validate Findings and Report

- [ ] Verify structural findings through at least one dependency path, call path, registration path, public contract, or reproducible analysis result.
- [ ] Filter generated code, framework conventions, deliberate adapters, test-only architecture, and documented exceptions before confirming a violation.
- [ ] Apply the materiality gate: require concrete correctness, security, ownership, deployment, change amplification, or recurring maintenance impact at evidenced scale. Reject taste, theoretical purity, generic practice, hypothetical scale, and reasonable alternatives; require the outcome or constraint, not a preferred implementation.
- [ ] Ground external corrections in version-matched official contracts, using primary engineering sources for unresolved tradeoffs. Cite the supported mechanism; local evidence suffices for local defects.
- [ ] Classify findings as `P0`-`P3` based on correctness, security, change amplification, deployment coupling, and recurring maintenance cost.
- [ ] Order recommendations by prerequisite and risk reduction, separating immediate correctness fixes from optional evolution.
- [ ] Use `BLOCKED` when required runtime wiring, boundary evidence, or an authoritative contract cannot be verified without a credible fallback; use `FAIL` for an evidenced unresolved correctness or security boundary defect, unsafe ownership ambiguity, or `P0/P1` structural risk; use `CONCERNS` only for material non-blocking change amplification, and `PASS` only when no evidenced architecture defect creates material cost or risk.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Actual modules, boundaries, wiring, dependencies, configuration, and critical flows; distinguish current, target, transition, and drift. Findings need priority, affected boundary, evidence, consequence at current scale, unacceptable tradeoff, migration risk, and smallest safe next step; allow equivalent target shapes. Order evolution by prerequisites and preserve accepted exceptions.
