# Architecture Migration Planner

**Goal:** Plan a safe transition from evidenced current architecture to an explicit target, with reversibility limits and recovery actions. Change only the approved migration document; do not execute migrations, edit product code, build a generic task plan, approve delivery, or hide irreversible steps.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred capability | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Current and target states | Repository evidence plus approved architecture artifacts | Explicit user-provided states with limitations |
| Consumers and compatibility | Language intelligence, schema tools, config search, telemetry, and direct inspection | Conservative inventory marked `UNVERIFIED` |
| Data scale and runtime risk | Production metrics, checked-in reports, migrations, and workload evidence | Ranges with validation gates before execution |
| External migration constraints | Official vendor migration and compatibility guidance | Mark dependent phases `BLOCKED` or `UNVERIFIED` |
| Document mutation | Minimal patch to the approved migration-plan artifact | Return `BLOCKED` when authority or path is unclear |

A migration phase must leave the system in a supported state. Additive and reversible steps precede cutover; destructive cleanup follows verified zero use.

## Artifact Rules

- Reuse a clear architecture migration document; otherwise use `docs/architecture/migration-plan.md`.
- Treat current-state, target-design, baseline, decisions, diagrams, interfaces, and telemetry as optional shared evidence.
- Keep the plan architectural: phases, compatibility, data, topology, gates, rollback, ownership, and removal.
- Leave file-level implementation tasks to downstream planning.
- Never describe rollback as "revert" when data or external effects are not reversible.
- Give every destructive step explicit approval, backup, restoration, and zero-consumer evidence requirements.

## Checklist

### 1. Establish the Transition Contract

- [ ] Resolve migration scope, business outcome, current state, target state, non-goals, deadline or horizon, owners, and approved destination.
- [ ] Read repository instructions, Git state, relevant architecture artifacts, migrations, deployment configuration, and compatibility policies.
- [ ] Verify that current and target states are specific enough to compute a gap; return `BLOCKED` rather than invent either state.
- [ ] Identify protected user journeys, invariants, SLOs, recovery objectives, compliance duties, and change windows.
- [ ] Keep the run read-only except for the approved migration document.

### 2. Build the Gap and Dependency Map

- [ ] Inventory affected modules, deployables, data stores, schemas, APIs, events, configuration, infrastructure, and operational procedures.
- [ ] Inventory internal and external consumers, owners, versions, traffic, data volume, and evidence quality.
- [ ] Map current-to-target changes in boundaries, ownership, contracts, data, runtime topology, observability, and failure behavior.
- [ ] Identify shared mutable resources, sequencing dependencies, long-running work, mixed-version windows, and irreversible effects.
- [ ] Record unknown consumers or usage as migration risks; absence of search results is not zero usage.

### 3. Design Compatibility and Data Safety

- [ ] Define old/new contract compatibility, version negotiation, adapters, dual-read or dual-write behavior, and deprecation policy where relevant.
- [ ] Use expand/migrate/contract when mixed versions or online migration require coexistence; separate additive and destructive releases in that case. For an approved offline atomic transition, document the equivalent compatibility, recovery, and downtime controls.
- [ ] Define backfill selection, batching, throttling, idempotency, checkpoints, retries, reconciliation, and correctness oracle.
- [ ] Define source of truth during coexistence, concurrent-write conflict handling, and detection, retry, and reconciliation of partial dual-write failure; do not assume two writes are atomic.
- [ ] Define backup, restore, RPO/RTO impact, privacy, retention, and audit evidence for data movement.

### 4. Build Reversible Phases

- [ ] Define preparation, shadow or coexistence, progressive migration, cutover, stabilization, and old-path removal as independently verifiable phases.
- [ ] For every phase, state prerequisites, changed architecture state, owner, entry gate, observable success, abort condition, rollback or roll-forward action, and exit evidence.
- [ ] Define feature flags, routing controls, canary cohorts, rate limits, maintenance windows, and blast-radius controls where justified.
- [ ] Define metrics, logs, traces, reconciliation reports, dashboards, alerts, and SLO gates needed before traffic or data movement.
- [ ] Keep old and new versions interoperable through realistic deployment ordering and rollback windows.

### 5. Plan Cutover and Removal

- [ ] Define go/no-go authority, communication, freeze conditions, exact cutover control, and immediate verification.
- [ ] Define rollback boundaries separately for code, configuration, traffic, schema, and migrated data, including points of no return and roll-forward recovery when rollback would lose accepted writes.
- [ ] Before destructive removal, require usage evidence over a window covering relevant schedules and offline consumers, migrated consumers, applicable retention expiry, and explicit approval. A short zero-traffic sample cannot establish zero use.
- [ ] List old code paths, contracts, flags, adapters, jobs, data, infrastructure, dashboards, and documentation to remove.
- [ ] Define post-cutover observation period, ownership handoff, incident response, and closure evidence.

### 6. Write and Report

- [ ] Write transition summary, state gap, dependencies, compatibility, data plan, phased sequence, gates, observability, rollback, removal, owners, assumptions, and open decisions.
- [ ] Link shared artifacts by stable repository path or title without requiring a particular workflow.
- [ ] Re-read every phase for unsupported zero-downtime, zero-loss, consumer, capacity, or reversibility claims.
- [ ] Use `READY` only when phases are safely executable inputs to implementation planning; use `REVISE` for material compatibility, data, gate, or rollback gaps; use `BLOCKED` when current state, target state, authority, or safety evidence is unavailable.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Artifact path; current/target gap, consumers, dependencies, and protected invariants. Summarize phases with entry gates, changes, success evidence, abort conditions, rollback/roll-forward; data/coexistence/reconciliation/cutover/removal proof; and open decisions that affect safety, ordering, or reversibility.
