# Current Architecture Documenter

**Goal:** Produce a trustworthy snapshot of the architecture implemented in the checked-out repository. Document what exists and how it behaves; do not score it, prescribe a target architecture, repair code, or turn intended diagrams into facts.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred capability | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Snapshot identity and worktree state | Git status, branch, remote, and HEAD | Record the supplied snapshot as `UNVERIFIED` |
| Structure and configuration | Native listing, search, manifests, and direct file reads | Narrow manual inspection |
| Symbols, dependencies, and consumers | Language intelligence or resolved dependency tooling | Search definitions, registrations, imports, and callers |
| Runtime and deployment topology | Entrypoints, IaC, containers, CI, configuration, and runtime evidence | Mark deployment relationships `UNKNOWN` |
| Document mutation | Minimal patch to the approved architecture document | Return `BLOCKED` if no writable path is authorized |

Prefer local evidence over remote repository state. A path, diagram, or naming convention is a lead until executable wiring or an authoritative contract confirms it.

## Artifact Rules

- Reuse a clear current-state architecture document; otherwise use `docs/architecture/current-state.md`.
- Anchor the document to remote, branch, HEAD, worktree state, and observation date.
- Cite material claims with file paths, symbols, commands, or configuration keys.
- Label claims `OBSERVED`, `DOCUMENTED`, `INFERRED`, or `UNKNOWN`.
- Separate actual structure from intended target design and from audit findings.
- Map the declared system scope at a coarse level first, then deepen only what explains its critical behavior; do not expand a bounded request into a repository-wide inventory.
- Prefer responsibility-oriented descriptions over exhaustive file inventories.
- Record the evidence cutoff so readers can distinguish uninspected scope from genuine absence.
- Keep volatile counts or inventories only when they affect architectural understanding.

## Checklist

### 1. Establish the Documentation Contract

- [ ] Resolve repository scope, intended readers, approved destination, required depth, and language.
- [ ] Read repository instructions and record snapshot identity plus dirty-worktree limitations.
- [ ] Search for existing current-state, baseline, target-design, decision, diagram, and deployment artifacts.
- [ ] Reuse an unambiguous current-state document or select the default path without duplicating project knowledge.
- [ ] Keep the run read-only except for the approved architecture document.

### 2. Map the System Breadth

- [ ] Identify languages, frameworks, package roots, generated surfaces, and canonical build or run commands from manifests and CI.
- [ ] Identify users, external systems, entrypoints, applications, services, processes, workers, scheduled jobs, and deployment units.
- [ ] Map major domains or modules, responsibilities, ownership, and dependency direction.
- [ ] Map data stores, caches, queues, files, external APIs, schemas, and systems of record.
- [ ] Record public interfaces, runtime discovery, registration, configuration composition, and environment boundaries.
- [ ] Record build, deploy, scale, and failure boundaries without inferring independence from directory names.

### 3. Trace Critical Behavior

- [ ] Select representative critical flows based on business importance and architectural reach.
- [ ] Trace each flow from actor or trigger through entrypoint, runtime coordination, domain behavior, persistence or integration, and observable outcome.
- [ ] Record synchronous and asynchronous hops, transaction ownership, consistency, retry, timeout, idempotency, and error propagation where evidenced.
- [ ] Describe deployment, startup, shutdown, health, observability, and recovery paths visible from repository evidence.
- [ ] Deepen only subsystems whose complexity or uncertainty affects architectural understanding; keep ordinary implementation detail out of the architecture document.

### 4. Write the Current-State Artifact

- [ ] Write snapshot identity, system context, component inventory, responsibilities, dependency and data flow, runtime topology, critical flows, deployment, ownership, and evidence index.
- [ ] Include the minimum useful diagrams inline or link existing diagram artifacts by path.
- [ ] Distinguish observed implementation from documented intent and explicitly list drift or contradictions without assigning severity.
- [ ] Mark remote-only, runtime-only, organizational, or production facts `UNKNOWN` unless supplied authoritative evidence establishes them; distinguish declared deployment configuration from observed live topology.
- [ ] Preserve sourced manually maintained context with its evidence status; document contradictions and label unsupported historical claims instead of inheriting them as observed facts.

### 5. Verify and Report

- [ ] Verify every citation against inspected snapshot evidence and remove unsupported claims; reopen sources only if they changed or the prior inspection did not establish the claim.
- [ ] Confirm the map explains how critical behavior is discovered, executed, persisted, and deployed.
- [ ] Confirm abstraction levels are not mixed and names remain consistent across prose and diagrams.
- [ ] Use `DOCUMENTED` when the snapshot is evidence-backed and useful; use `INCONCLUSIVE` when material topology remains unknown; use `BLOCKED` when repository identity, scope, or destination cannot be established safely.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Artifact path and snapshot identity (remote, branch, HEAD, worktree, date); mapped context, modules, runtime/deployment, data/interfaces, ownership, and critical flows. Identify changed sections/diagrams and claims or areas needing runtime, organizational, or external confirmation with status, inspected evidence, and exact next action.
