# Architecture Decision Recorder

**Goal:** Preserve the context, forces, alternatives, decision, and consequences of one architecturally significant choice in a compact durable record. Change only approved decision documentation; do not design the whole system, approve a decision silently, delete history, audit code, or implement the choice.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred capability | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Existing decision convention | Repository search and direct document reads | Use the default path and compact format |
| Decision drivers | Requirements, architecture artifacts, implementation evidence, and stakeholder statements | Mark unsupported drivers `UNKNOWN` |
| Alternatives and external claims | Repository evidence plus current official sources | Mark time-sensitive claims `UNVERIFIED` |
| Sequence and supersession | Existing filenames, indexes, and decision links | Return `BLOCKED` rather than reuse a number |
| Document mutation | Minimal patch to one approved decision record and necessary supersession links | Return `BLOCKED` if authority or path is unclear |

One record captures one decision. If the request contains independent decisions with different drivers or lifecycles, split them only with explicit approval.

## Artifact Rules

- Reuse the repository's established ADR convention when one exists.
- Otherwise use `docs/architecture/decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md` with the next unused monotonic number.
- Never renumber, delete, or rewrite the decision and rationale of historical records. Permit scoped status and supersession-link updates under the rules below; distinguish evolving proposed drafts from accepted history.
- Default a new record to `Proposed`.
- Use `Accepted` only after explicit confirmation from an authorized decision-maker.
- A proposed replacement links to the current decision without changing its effective status. Mark the old record `Superseded` and link both directions only after the replacement is explicitly accepted; preserve historical content.
- Keep the record short enough to review as a single decision.
- Preserve the rationale a future maintainer needs to reconsider it safely.
- Label retrospective records explicitly; do not imply that documentation created after implementation was prior approval.
- Separate evidence needed before acceptance from monitoring required after adoption.
- Prefer stable repository references over conversation, branch-local, or ephemeral links.

## Checklist

### 1. Establish the Decision Contract

- [ ] Resolve the exact decision, scope, owner or deciders, affected system, and why the choice is architecturally significant.
- [ ] Read repository instructions, Git state, and existing decision conventions.
- [ ] Search for duplicate, conflicting, deprecated, or superseding decisions before allocating a new record.
- [ ] Confirm the request is one decision rather than a broad design or implementation plan.
- [ ] Resolve the approved status; default to `Proposed` when acceptance is not explicit.

### 2. Gather Context and Forces

- [ ] State the current context and problem in value-neutral language.
- [ ] Extract business drivers, quality attributes, constraints, assumptions, and decision horizon from available evidence.
- [ ] Identify affected boundaries, contracts, data, security, operations, cost, ownership, and migration implications.
- [ ] Separate present facts from forecasts and preferences.
- [ ] Record contradictions or missing evidence that could change the choice.

### 3. Evaluate Alternatives

- [ ] Include the status quo and the simplest credible option unless they are demonstrably infeasible.
- [ ] Include materially different alternatives rather than cosmetic variants.
- [ ] Compare options against the same drivers: correctness, quality targets, complexity, reversibility, cost, operations, team fit, and evolution.
- [ ] State why each rejected alternative loses in this context without claiming universal inferiority.
- [ ] Record sensitivity or review triggers that would make a rejected option preferable later.

### 4. Record the Decision

- [ ] Write title, status, date, deciders or owner, context, drivers, considered options, decision, consequences, validation, and review triggers.
- [ ] State the decision in active, testable language and name what remains deliberately undecided.
- [ ] Record positive, negative, and neutral consequences plus accepted risks.
- [ ] Link affected requirements, designs, diagrams, interfaces, migration documents, or issues by stable repository reference.
- [ ] Apply the Artifact Rules for proposed or accepted supersession; verify links and preserve prior rationale.

### 5. Validate and Report

- [ ] Confirm the record contains one decision and can be understood without conversation history.
- [ ] Confirm consequential claims have evidence or labelled assumptions/unknowns with validation actions; never invent historical rationale or rejected alternatives for a retrospective record.
- [ ] Confirm `Accepted` was not assigned without explicit authority.
- [ ] Use `RECORDED` when the record and status are valid; use `INCOMPLETE` when material context or required acceptance authority remains unresolved; a complete explicitly Proposed record does not require acceptance to be `RECORDED`; use `BLOCKED` for ambiguous scope, unsafe numbering, conflicting ownership, or no writable destination.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Artifact path, decision identity/status/owner, selected option, alternatives, consequences, evidence, and acceptance/validation needs. Report links or status changes to historical records, preserving their rationale; identify unresolved choices and review triggers without implying acceptance of a proposal.
