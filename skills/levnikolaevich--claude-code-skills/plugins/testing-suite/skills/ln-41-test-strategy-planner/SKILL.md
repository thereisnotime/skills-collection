# Test Strategy Planner

**Goal:** Design a read-only, risk-based test portfolio decision for the requested scope. Maximize confidence in important local behavior while preventing test growth that lacks a unique defect signal, and define how affected evidence is retained, changed, consolidated, retired, or deliberately omitted.

**Execution contract:** The ordered checkboxes are the Definition of Done. Track every item internally as `PENDING`, `PROVEN` with concrete evidence, `CLEARED` with evidence that its condition is absent, or `UNPROVEN` with a gap; reading, delegation, or tool failure is not proof. Reconcile items after each section. Before returning, resolve all `PENDING` and count only `PROVEN` and `CLEARED`; apply the skill's verdict and approval rules to every gap.
Preserve user intent, scope, and existing authorization. Continue authorized work; ask only for consequential unresolved choices or required external approval. Scale depth to material risk without silently skipping checks. Preserve dependency and safety ordering; otherwise choose the verification method appropriate to each obligation.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred tool | Use it when | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Requirements and repository rules | Native file reads plus Git | Establishing scope, current work, acceptance criteria, and supported commands | User-provided requirements with explicit limitations |
| Existing test surface | File listing, search, manifests, runner configuration, and CI | Mapping test levels, fixtures, environments, and conventions | Repository tree and known test entrypoints |
| Behavior and boundaries | Language server or host-native code intelligence | Tracing entrypoints, consumers, trust boundaries, persistence, queues, and external contracts | Narrow search followed by direct inspection |
| Existing evidence | Existing test/CI reports, test reads, and safe repository commands | A material uncertainty about current proof can change the strategy | Use static evidence with execution limits; do not run suites merely to produce a plan |
| Current external failure modes | Official documentation, specifications, advisories, and primary field evidence | An external contract or real user failure can change scenarios or priority | Mark the claim `UNVERIFIED`; do not invent risk |

Keep the run read-only. Do not create tests, fixtures, snapshots, tasks, or documentation, and do not update the reviewed implementation.

## Evidence Rules

- Choose the smallest reliable boundary that proves each material risk. Use end-to-end evidence when the terminal journey cannot be established lower; preserve distinct unit, integration, and contract proof where they detect different failures.
- Coverage is discovery evidence, not proof. Require an oracle that would fail for the named defect.
- Prioritize by impact, plausible failure, uniqueness, detectability, and recovery cost; do not convert those judgments into universal numeric thresholds.
- Existing tests reduce a gap only when their setup and assertions prove the same behavior and failure mode.
- Framework, language, ORM, serializer, or library behavior is not a product test unless local configuration or integration changes its contract.
- Keep portfolio action separate from execution status. Use `KEEP`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE`, `DELETE`, or `NO_TEST` for the decision and `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNPROVEN` only for evidence state.
- `NO_TEST` is an explicit risk decision, not missing work. Name the existing proof, alternative control, or accepted residual risk.
- A persistent test register is optional. Prefer repository-native test names, paths, tags, CI configuration, and task output unless scale or governance requires another maintained artifact.
- External research is actionable only when it adds a concrete failure mode, boundary, or oracle to this plan.

## Checklist

### 1. Establish Scope and Evidence

- [ ] Resolve the feature, requirements, acceptance criteria, actors, explicit non-goals, and protected human or system outcomes; separate the requested mechanism from the result it must enable and return `BLOCKED` if there is no concrete behavior to plan for.
- [ ] Read applicable repository instructions and inspect Git state so current work and unrelated changes are not mistaken for established behavior.
- [ ] Detect languages, frameworks, runners, test directories, fixtures, factories, environments, CI gates, coverage, contract tests, and manual test surfaces.
- [ ] Map existing evidence and every test affected by the requested behavior to each requirement; record coverage as complete, partial, missing, or unavailable based on the actual oracle, alongside the execution state defined in Evidence Rules; names and proximity are not proof.
- [ ] Inspect manual, exploratory, incident, and production evidence when it reveals behavior that automated suites do not cover.
- [ ] Identify environment, data, credentials, services, devices, browsers, and destructive-state constraints before proposing scenarios.
- [ ] Record assumptions and unknowns that can change test level, priority, or feasibility, and ask one concise question only when different interpretations materially change the strategy.

### 2. Build the Risk Map

- [ ] Trace critical flows from actor trigger through entrypoint, runtime wiring, state change, and durable or user-visible outcome.
- [ ] Identify uniquely important local behavior involving money, authentication, authorization, ownership, data integrity, destructive actions, migrations, public contracts, or irreversible workflows.
- [ ] Enumerate plausible defect classes: incorrect success, rejected valid input, accepted invalid input, boundary error, partial failure, duplicate delivery, ordering, timeout, retry, cancellation, race, rollback, recovery, and compatibility drift; state what protected outcome is lost or what concrete harm follows.
- [ ] Separate product risks from implementation details and behavior already guaranteed by a dependency; exclude technically representable states that protect no unique local outcome or decision.
- [ ] Identify privacy-sensitive or regulated test data and require synthetic, minimized, or explicitly approved fixtures.
- [ ] Use current external evidence only when version-sensitive contracts, recurring user failures, abuse patterns, or interoperability risks can change the map.
- [ ] Rank risks qualitatively and explain ties or uncertainty; do not manufacture precision from missing frequency or impact data.

### 3. Decide Portfolio Actions, Levels, and Oracles

- [ ] Assign every material risk and affected test exactly one provisional action: `KEEP` when trusted unique proof remains valid; `ADD` for an unproved material risk; `UPDATE` when valuable intent remains but basis, boundary, setup, or oracle changed; `MERGE` for safely consolidatable proof; `DELETE` for obsolete, duplicate, trivial, or untrustworthy proof; or `NO_TEST` when another control or accepted risk is sufficient.
- [ ] For `DELETE` or `MERGE`, prove that the test basis is obsolete or identify replacement evidence that preserves every still-required material behavior, failure mode, oracle, and useful failure localization; never retain obsolete proof merely because it already exists.
- [ ] Choose unit tests for isolated local rules, contract tests for producer-consumer agreement, integration tests for owned boundaries, and end-to-end tests for production-shaped journeys whose terminal outcome cannot be proved lower.
- [ ] Avoid duplicating the same behavior at every level unless each level detects a distinct failure class.
- [ ] Define the minimum sufficient independent oracle, combining observations when the contract requires them: returned contract, durable state, emitted event, rendered behavior, external effect, invariant, or deterministic artifact.
- [ ] Check that mocks and fakes do not bypass the boundary or failure semantics the scenario claims to prove.
- [ ] Use stable project-native semantic locators (roles, accessible names, labels) or explicit IDs/test hooks according to the observable contract and locale strategy. Avoid styling, position, timing, and incidental structure. Treat exact-copy assertions separately when copy is a requirement; do not require product edits solely to add hooks when a robust semantic locator exists.
- [ ] Include positive, invalid, boundary, authorization, error, recovery, concurrency, and compatibility cases only where the risk map makes them material.
- [ ] Specify non-default configuration, time, locale, randomness, ordering, or data scale when defaults could conceal hard-coded behavior.
- [ ] Add browser, device, operating-system, runtime, or version cells only when the supported contract or a known risk makes them decision-relevant.
- [ ] Prefer deterministic setup and bounded data; identify where real dependencies, emulators, disposable environments, or production-like topology are necessary.
- [ ] Define the repository gate or diagnostic role, entry prerequisites, and evidence-based completion criteria for each portfolio action; do not use test count or raw coverage as completion.

### 4. Produce a Prioritized Test Matrix

- [ ] For every decision, name the test basis, protected outcome, risk, existing evidence or affected test, portfolio action, level, setup, oracle, expected evidence, environment, gate, and result state when known.
- [ ] Define a review or retirement trigger for evidence whose value depends on a contract, migration, compatibility window, workaround, incident, dependency, or temporary risk; do not invent dates without an owned reason.
- [ ] Order scenarios so safety-critical and high-information checks run before expensive breadth, while preserving prerequisite and state dependencies.
- [ ] Identify which scenarios can run in parallel and which share mutable state, rate limits, accounts, devices, or environment setup.
- [ ] Classify gates by failure consequence and required detection time; place slow diagnostic checks outside routine gates only when another control covers release-critical risk.
- [ ] State exclusions explicitly, including scenarios with no unique protected outcome or defect signal, low-value duplication, framework behavior, infeasible environments, and accepted residual risks.
- [ ] Use `READY` when the strategy is executable and decision-complete, `INCONCLUSIVE` when useful partial planning is possible but material evidence is missing, and `BLOCKED` when requirements or a safety-critical boundary cannot be established.
- [ ] Reconcile the risk map and decision ledger: no material risk or affected test lacks an action and supporting rationale.
- [ ] State the smallest next evidence-gathering action for every `INCONCLUSIVE` or `BLOCKED` area.

## Self-Check

- [ ] **Reconcile before returning.** Check item-level evidence, requirement coverage, contradictions, scope, verdict, and applicable cleanup. Correct the report or authorized artifacts. Reuse valid evidence; do not automatically rescan the repository or rerun successful commands. Repeat checks only for relevant changes, failures, or unresolved evidence. Disclose remaining gaps.

## Output Contract

Report in the user's language, in this order; retain all five fields and state each fact once. Small results may use one line per field; omit empty tables and do not copy linked artifacts:

1. **Result:** Skill-specific verdict and supported outcome.
2. **Scope:** Reviewed/changed scope, exclusions, baseline, and material assumptions.
3. **Evidence:** Skill-specific fields below; distinguish facts, inferences, and unverified claims. Link artifacts; use tables when useful.
4. **Verification:** Checks/results, unavailable evidence, and applicable cleanup/external state.
5. **Completion:** `Checklist: X/Y complete`; `Incomplete: None` or each `UNPROVEN` item's reason, outcome impact, and exact next action; residual risks and required decisions.

**Skill-specific evidence:** Protected outcome → defect class → impact → existing proof → priority. Per affected test or gap: portfolio action, level/scenario/environment, independent oracle, required/diagnostic gate and result, and review/retirement trigger. Report net portfolio effect and justified `NO_TEST`, excluded low-value duplication, environment needs, and exact evidence actions for inconclusive areas.
