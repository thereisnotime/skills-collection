# Claude-Codex Skills

A compact marketplace of standalone engineering skills for Claude Code and Codex.

Supports the portable [Agent Plugins v1 standard](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) while retaining native Claude Code and Codex distribution compatibility.

> **Why this repository is intentionally small:** Earlier coding models needed a large orchestration and evaluation harness to follow complex workflows reliably. Modern Claude and Codex models work better with concise procedural guidance, so that machinery has been removed. These skills retain only the domain knowledge, decision gates, tool guidance, and evidence checklists worth bringing into context.

[Browse the skills catalog](https://levnikolaevich.github.io/claude-code-skills/) or install only the plugins you need below.

The repository intentionally contains only the skills, minimal plugin manifests, two host-specific marketplace catalogs, documentation, and a static catalog site. It has no MCP servers, orchestration hierarchy, distributed shared resources, generated skill copies, or evaluation harness.

## Install in Claude Code

Add the marketplace and install only the suites you need:

```text
/plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
/plugin install review-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install codebase-audit-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install optimization-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install testing-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install product-discovery-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install maintainer-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install architecture-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/reload-plugins
```

Invoke a skill by its namespaced name, for example `/review-suite:ln-12-delivery-reviewer`.

For local development, load one plugin directly:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/review-suite
```

## Install in Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
codex plugin add review-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
codex plugin add codebase-audit-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace

## Repository layout

├── .agents/plugins/marketplace.json       # Codex catalog

```

Each plugin contains a portable Agent Plugins v1 `plugin.json`, the current `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` OpenAI host adapter, and one shared `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` tree.

This is the smallest practical shared layout for distributed plugins:

- Both hosts use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so each skill has one canonical copy.
- Agent Plugins clients discover the portable package through root `plugin.json`; its minimal manifest owns only the schema target and stable name.
- Current ChatGPT and Codex packaging still requires `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, which remains the single owner of mutable version, description, publisher, and interface metadata.
- Claude Code scans each marketplace source's standard `skills/` directory, so a duplicate Claude-specific plugin manifest is unnecessary.
- `agents/openai.yaml`, references, scripts, assets, hooks, agents, and MCP configuration are optional and omitted until a concrete need appears.

The structure follows the [Agent Plugins v1 specification](https://agent-plugins.org/specification), current [OpenAI plugin guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins), [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), [Claude Code skill guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), and [Claude Code plugin reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## Indexing

The first digit identifies the plugin and the second identifies the skill within it: `1x` review, `2x` audit, `3x` optimization, `4x` testing, `5x` product discovery, `6x` repository maintenance, and `7x` architecture artifact creation. See the canonical allocation and overflow rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#index-system).
