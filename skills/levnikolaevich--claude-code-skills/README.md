# Lev Nikolaevich Skills

A compact marketplace of standalone engineering skills for Claude Code and Codex.

[Browse the Skills v2 catalog](https://levnikolaevich.github.io/claude-code-skills/) or install only the plugins you need below.

The repository intentionally contains only the skills, minimal plugin manifests, two host-specific marketplace catalogs, documentation, and a static catalog site. It has no MCP servers, orchestration hierarchy, distributed shared resources, generated skill copies, or evaluation harness.

## Install in Claude Code

Add the marketplace and install only the suites you need:

```text
/plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
/plugin install review-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install codebase-audit-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install optimization-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install testing-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
/plugin install product-discovery-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
```

For local development, load one plugin directly:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/review-suite
```

## Install in Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
codex plugin add review-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
codex plugin add codebase-audit-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
codex plugin add optimization-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
codex plugin add testing-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
codex plugin add product-discovery-suite@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
```

## Repository layout

```text
.
├── .agents/plugins/marketplace.json       # Codex catalog
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json        # Claude Code catalog
└── plugins/
    ├── review-suite/
    ├── codebase-audit-suite/
    ├── optimization-suite/
    ├── testing-suite/
    └── product-discovery-suite/
```

Each plugin contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for Codex and a shared `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` tree used by both hosts.

This is the smallest practical shared layout for distributed plugins:

- Both hosts use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so each skill has one canonical copy.
- Codex requires `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for a plugin.
- Claude Code can expose a standard `skills/` directory from the marketplace entry, so duplicate per-plugin Claude manifests are unnecessary here.
- `agents/openai.yaml`, references, scripts, assets, hooks, agents, and MCP configuration are optional and omitted until a concrete need appears.

The structure follows the current official [Codex skill guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills), [Codex plugin guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-plugins), [Claude Code skill guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), and [Claude Code plugin reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## Migration from v1

Skills v2 replaces the broad workflow framework with small, standalone capabilities. Existing cached installations are not removed automatically: reinstall the desired v2 plugins and start a new Claude Code or Codex session after updating the marketplace.

| Previous plugin | v2 status |
|---|---|
| `agile-workflow` | Retired. Plan and delivery review moved to `review-suite`; focused audit, testing, optimization, and discovery work moved to their respective suites. Backlog orchestration and task execution are intentionally not retained. |
| `documentation-pipeline` | Retired. Read-only documentation assessment is covered by `ln-21-documentation-auditor`; document-generation pipelines are not retained. |
| `project-bootstrap` | Retired without replacement; use project-native setup and host-native tools. |
| `community-engagement` | Retired without replacement; it is outside the engineering-skill catalog. |
| `setup-environment` | Retired without replacement; host setup and MCP installation are no longer managed by these skills. |

Every published version of `@levnikolaevich/hex-line-mcp`, `@levnikolaevich/hex-graph-mcp`, `@levnikolaevich/hex-research-mcp`, and `@levnikolaevich/hex-ssh-mcp` is deprecated on npm. Their source and publishing infrastructure were removed from the active tree. The packages receive no updates or support and must not be used for new Skills v2 workflows; historical source remains in Git history and release tags.

## Indexing

The first digit identifies the plugin and the second identifies the skill within it: `1x` review, `2x` audit, `3x` optimization, `4x` testing, and `5x` product discovery. See the canonical allocation and overflow rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#index-system).
