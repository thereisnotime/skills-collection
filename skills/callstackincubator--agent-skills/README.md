# Agent Skills

A collection of agent-optimized skills for AI coding assistants. The repo ships raw Agent Skills for assistants that can read `skills/` directly, plus marketplace metadata for both Claude Code and Codex plugin workflows.

## React Native Best Practices

Performance optimization skills based on [**The Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization**](https://www.callstack.com/ebooks/the-ultimate-guide-to-react-native-optimization) by [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/).

Covers:

- **JavaScript/React**: Profiling, FPS, re-renders, lists, state management, animations
- **Native**: iOS/Android profiling, TTI, memory management, Turbo Modules
- **Bundling**: Bundle analysis, tree shaking, R8, app size optimization

### Quick Start

#### Claude Code

Use the Claude Code marketplace metadata in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

**1. Add the marketplace:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add callstackincubator/agent-skills
```

**2. Install the skill you want:**

```bash
/plugin install react-native-best-practices@callstack-agent-skills
```

Other available installs:

```bash
/plugin install github@callstack-agent-skills
/plugin install github-actions@callstack-agent-skills
/plugin install upgrading-react-native@callstack-agent-skills
/plugin install react-native-brownfield-migration@callstack-agent-skills
```

Or use the interactive menu:

```bash
/plugin menu
```

**For local development:**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/agent-skills
```

Once installed, Claude will automatically load the relevant skill based on the task.

#### OpenAI Codex

This repo supports Codex in two different ways.

**Option 1: Install the bundled Codex plugins**

```bash
npx codex-plugin add callstackincubator/agent-skills
```

This reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, installs the bundled plugins into `.codex/plugins/`, and makes them available after restarting Codex.

**Option 2: Install standalone skills**

All major AI coding assistants support the Agent Skills standard.

**Install via skill-installer:**

```
$skill-installer install react-native-best-practices from callstackincubator/agent-skills
```

**Or clone manually:**

```bash
# Project-level
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git
cp -r agent-skills/skills/* .codex/skills/

# User-level
cp -r agent-skills/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/
```

Restart Codex to recognize newly installed skills.

**Usage:** Type `$` to mention a skill or use `/skills` command.

These skills include `agents/openai.yaml` metadata for Codex Skills UI compatibility.

#### Other AI Assistants

##### Cursor

**Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)**

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd+Shift+J` / `Ctrl+Shift+J`)
2. Navigate to **Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub)**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git`

**Option 2: Local Installation**

```bash
# Project-level
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git .cursor/skills/agent-skills

# User-level (available in all projects)
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git ~/.cursor/skills/agent-skills
```

**Usage:** Type `/` in Agent chat to search and select skills by name.

##### Gemini CLI

**Install from repository:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git
```

**Or install to workspace:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git --scope workspace
```

**Management commands:**
- `/skills list` - view all discovered skills
- `/skills enable <name>` / `/skills disable <name>` - toggle availability
- `/skills reload` - refresh skill inventory

##### OpenCode

Clone to any supported skills directory:

```bash
# Project-level
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills.git
cp -r agent-skills/skills/* .opencode/skill/

# User-level
cp -r agent-skills/skills/* ~/.config/opencode/skill/
```

OpenCode also discovers Claude-compatible paths (`.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`).

**Permission control** in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Other Assistants

For assistants without native skills support, point them to the skill file:

```
Read skills/react-native-best-practices/SKILL.md for React Native performance guidelines
```

Or reference specific topics:

```
Look up js-profile-react.md for React DevTools profiling instructions
```

### Code Examples

The [callstack/optimization-best-practices](https://github.com/callstack/optimization-best-practices) repository contains runnable code examples for:

- React Compiler setup
- Dedicated React Native SDKs vs web polyfills
- R8 code shrinking on Android

## Other AI Assistants

See [AI Assistant Integration Guide](./docs/ai-assistant-integration.md) for detailed setup instructions with Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude API, ChatGPT, and other AI coding assistants.

```

Use `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for Claude Code plugin installs and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex plugin installs.

The standalone `skills/` directory contains repo-local skills. The `plugins/` directory contains installable Codex plugin bundles.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Skills should be:

- **Actionable**: Step-by-step instructions, not theory
- **Searchable**: Clear headings and keywords
- **Complete**: Include code examples and common pitfalls

When adding or editing skills, follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and [Claude Code best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices). The maintainer checklist lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), with supporting details in [docs/skill-conventions.md](./docs/skill-conventions.md).

## Roadmap / Work in Progress

This is just the start! The following features are planned or in progress.

### Visual Feedback Integration (Planned)

Several skills involve interpreting visual profiler output (flame graphs, treemaps, memory snapshots). AI agents cannot yet process these autonomously.

**Affected skills:**

- `js-profile-react.md` - React DevTools flame graphs
- `js-measure-fps.md` - FPS graphs and performance overlays
- `native-profiling.md` - Xcode Instruments / Android Studio Profiler
- `native-measure-tti.md` - TTI timeline visualization
- `native-view-flattening.md` - View hierarchy inspection
- `bundle-analyze-js.md` - Bundle treemap visualization
- `bundle-analyze-app.md` - App size breakdown (Emerge Tools, Ruler)

**Planned solution:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for screenshot capture and visual analysis. Contributions welcome!

### Complementary Skills

For complete coverage, consider pairing with:

- [Vercel React Best Practices](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/react-best-practices/skills/react-best-practices) - React/Next.js web optimization (40+ rules)

### Future Work

- [ ] MCP integration for visual profiler feedback
- [ ] Additional skills for debugging, testing, and CI/CD
- [ ] More code examples and interactive tutorials
