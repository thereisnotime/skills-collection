# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-24

- **Breaking (license):** relicensed from MIT to Apache-2.0, along with the rest of
  the repository in Caveman 3.0.0. Releases before this one keep the MIT license.
- `onDecision` and `onDiagnostic` accept async sinks: a rejected promise is
  swallowed like a throw, as `onReport` already was, instead of an unhandled
  rejection that terminates Node.
- Callers that only waited on another call's shared capabilities fetch no longer
  record its failure in the breaker: one refused connect at cold start is one
  failure, not one per waiter. A call its host aborts records nothing (it used to
  record a success, so a cancelled half-open probe closed the breaker) and frees
  the probe slot. New `CircuitBreaker.release()`.
- A runtime token is trimmed of surrounding whitespace; any other character
  outside printable ASCII is `invalid_configuration`, as in Python.
- An `https://` or `socks` `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` is `invalid_configuration`
  with the unsupported scheme named by `ready()` and `preflight()`, instead of
  `runtime_unavailable` on every call. `MiddlewareError` takes an optional detail.
- `retrieve()` (and so the recovery binding) throws
  `MiddlewareError('invalid_request')` for arguments that are not an object with
  a string `handle`, never a `TypeError`.
- The `version_unverified` warn-once line reads `Caveman middleware is running on
  an unverified framework version`, because that call proceeds.
- CommonJS `node16` consumers can use `import sdk = require(...)` and
  `import * as` with values: the `.d.cts` shims re-export values, not only types.
- `@caveman-ai/sdk/middleware` is stable: the `@experimental` marker is gone,
  and it follows semver, because `@caveman-ai/middleware` 1.0 depends on it.
- A candidate whose `sourceId` is not a scope token is skipped as
  `unsupported`, as in Python.
- Exporter: cost is always exported as `doubleValue`, a whole-dollar amount
  too, as in Python.
- Middleware transport honors `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` without
  `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY`, never proxies loopback, and adds a `ca` option.
- Plan validation is total: any malformed plan is `invalid_plan`, never
  `adapter_error`.
- The breaker, Retry-After and the capabilities TTL use a monotonic clock.
  Retrieve and delete have their own concurrency budget. Server-advertised
  deadlines are capped (5 s optimize, 30 s retrieve).
- Stricter endpoint parsing; BOM-prefixed responses are rejected; a 429 with a
  bad UTF-8 body is still `capacity`.
- `preflight()` reports `unknown_capability` when no transform is usable.
  `counts.skipped` means sent minus replaced. A stale-revision refresh runs
  inline through the breaker.
- New `unsupported_provider` and `unsupported_request` reason codes.
- Exporter: user-supplied cache-creation attributes pass through again and
  are no longer clamped. Cost is also emitted as `caveman.usage.cost_usd`
  (`gen_ai.usage.cost_usd` is deprecated).
- New read-only `MiddlewareRuntime.strict`.
- `decline()` accepts any catalog `ReasonCode` and an optional adapter id,
  which the warn-once log line then names.
- `typesVersions` and `.d.cts` shims: TypeScript projects using node10 or
  node16 CommonJS resolution can import both entry points without
  `skipLibCheck`.
- `@caveman-ai/sdk/middleware` implements middleware protocol 1.1:
  - capabilities are parsed tolerantly, cached for 300 s and refreshed
    single-flight
  - plans survive a policy-revision change
  - errors are handled as the protocol specifies, including `Retry-After`
  - a new circuit breaker opens after 5 consecutive or 10 of 20 failures and
    counts deadlines
  - per-candidate budgets replace the whole-call bypass
- Security: replacements must be `exact_ccr`, carry the recovery marker and
  handle, and be strictly shorter in UTF-8 bytes. `recovery: "none"` output is
  never applied.
- Fixed a per-request memory leak (`AbortSignal.any`). The runtime token no
  longer appears in `JSON.stringify` or `util.inspect`.
- Local data errors no longer count as runtime outages, and 4xx responses no
  longer clear cached capabilities.
- New options: `maxConcurrency`, `allowInsecureTransport`, `onDecision`,
  `tracer`, `meter`. Endpoint path prefixes work, and `deadlineMs` defaults to
  the runtime's advertised value.
- The constructor never throws: endpoint and option errors warn once and show
  up in `ready()`/`preflight()`. `decline()` no longer throws in strict mode.
- **Breaking (experimental subpath):**
  - `recovery()` returns `null` for an invalid scope.
  - `deleteSession()` returns a `SessionDeleteResult`.
  - `validateCapabilities` is removed.
  - Scopes are normalized: values that aren't valid tokens are hashed to
    `h-…`.
- Requests send `Caveman-Middleware-Features`, `Caveman-Middleware-Client` and
  W3C trace context.
- Node floor lowered to `>=22.12`. CommonJS `require()` works through
  require(esm).
- OTel exporter: `cacheCreationTokens` is emitted as
  `gen_ai.usage.cache_creation.input_tokens`.
- Release process: each release gets a GitHub Release with these notes and a
  CycloneDX SBOM of its dependency graph.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-15

- Added the `@caveman-ai/sdk/middleware` subpath: the dependency-free protocol client, validation, deadlines and receipts that `@caveman-ai/middleware` adapters build on.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-26

- Recorded stable TypeScript SDK API and `/sdk/v1/*` wire baseline.
- Pinned coordinated-major and parity rules with Python SDK.
