# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-24

- **Breaking (license):** relicensed from MIT to Apache-2.0, along with the rest of
  the repository in Caveman 3.0.0. Releases before this one keep the MIT license.
- Callers that only waited on another call's shared capabilities fetch no longer
  record its failure in the breaker: one refused connect at cold start is one
  failure, not one per waiter. An interrupted half-open probe records nothing
  and frees the probe slot. New `CircuitBreaker.release()`.
- `observe()`/`observe_background()` normalize the receipt scope, as TypeScript
  does, and drop a receipt with an invalid scope. Async `observe()` has its own
  receipt worker (one worker, sixteen queued), so receipts never take optimize's
  slots.
- A runtime token is stripped of surrounding whitespace (a mounted secret file's
  trailing newline); a token with any other character outside printable ASCII
  is `invalid_configuration` instead of a `runtime_unavailable` on every call.
- An `https://` or `socks` proxy URL is `invalid_configuration`; `ready()` and
  `preflight()` name the unsupported scheme. `MiddlewareError` takes an optional
  detail.
- `endpoint` is the runtime origin (`scheme://host[:port]`), as in TypeScript,
  and `""` when the endpoint was refused; it never echoes userinfo.
- `delete_session()` validates the response like TypeScript: `schema_version`
  must be 1, `originals_deleted` is true only for a literal `true`, and
  `deleted` appears only with four safe non-negative integer counts.
- The recovery binding passes only `handle`/`offset`/`limit`/`query` to
  `retrieve()`; non-object arguments or a missing handle raise
  `MiddlewareError("invalid_request")`, which adapters turn into a tool error.
- Coroutine sinks (`on_report`, `on_decision`, `on_diagnostic`) run on the
  caller's event loop instead of leaking a "never awaited" warning; their
  failures never reach the call.
- The `version_unverified` warn-once line reads `Caveman middleware is running on
  an unverified framework version`, because that call proceeds.
- The transport bounds the whole exchange (connect, proxy tunnel, TLS, headers
  and body) by the deadline, and never reuses connections the server closed
  while idle.
- `aclose()` never blocks on a stuck worker.
- The first capabilities fetch is single-flight. An unusable capabilities view
  is refreshed once. Server-advertised deadlines are capped.
- JSON is parsed strictly (no NaN; integer-valued floats become ints), and
  endpoint parsing is stricter.
- Warn-once rules, the decision event's `runtime_build`, and `adapter_error`
  for an unserializable manifest now match TypeScript.
- New `unsupported_provider` and `unsupported_request` reason codes.
- Exporter: cost is also emitted as `caveman.usage.cost_usd`.
- The warn-once line now reads `Caveman middleware passed content through
  unchanged: adapter=… reason=…`, the same as TypeScript. Log filters that
  match the old `Caveman middleware decision:` prefix need updating.
- Strict `ready()`/`preflight()` now report the first `decline()`.
- `decline()` accepts any catalog reason and an optional adapter id, which the
  warn-once line names. It never raises in strict mode.
- Python floor lowered from 3.13 to 3.11.
- `caveman_cloud.middleware` implements middleware protocol 1.1 and is stable:
  it follows semver, because `caveman-middleware` 1.0 depends on it. Requests carry `Caveman-Middleware-Features`,
  `Caveman-Middleware-Client`, and, when a `tracer` is configured, `traceparent`/`tracestate` for the SDK's own span
  (never the application's ambient context, as in TypeScript).
- Capabilities are parsed tolerantly and cached for 300 s with single-flight
  refresh. A new policy revision or transform version no longer rejects a plan.
- Only `exact_ccr` replacements that carry the recovery marker and handle and are
  shorter in UTF-8 bytes are applied. `recovery: "none"` is never applied, which
  closes a text-injection path.
- New circuit breaker: opens after 5 consecutive or 10 of 20 failures, stays
  open 30 s, then allows one probe. Deadlines count; local and 4xx errors don't.
  Ill-formed Unicode is reported as `unsupported_shape`. `Retry-After` is honored.
- The default deadline comes from capabilities (500 ms before the first fetch).
  Retrieve has its own 5 s deadline and its own pool.
- Async calls respect their deadline even while queued. Pools are rebuilt after
  `fork()`. `aclose()` resolves in-flight calls as `closed` instead of raising
  `CancelledError`.
- Transport: keep-alive reuse; DNS, connect and TLS inside the deadline;
  `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`; `ssl_context`; a pluggable `transport`;
  endpoint path prefixes; `allow_insecure_transport`; `max_concurrency`.
- Per-candidate budgets replace the whole-call bypass at 256 candidates or 4096
  manifest items.
- Endpoint problems no longer raise at construction. `recovery()` returns `None`
  for an invalid scope. Scopes are normalized, so emails and spaces are hashed.
  `delete_session()` returns the result.
- New: warn-once logging on `caveman.middleware`, `on_decision` events
  (including `no_candidate`), opt-in OTel `tracer`/`meter`, and `as_sync()`,
  `ensure_sync()`, `ensure_async()`.
- The credential is kept out of `vars()`, `repr()` and pickling.
- `OTelExporter.record_span(cache_creation_tokens=)` emits
  `gen_ai.usage.cache_creation.input_tokens`. `gen_ai.usage.cost_usd` is
  deprecated; it stays through 1.x.
- Release process: each release gets a GitHub Release with these notes and a
  CycloneDX SBOM of its dependency graph.
