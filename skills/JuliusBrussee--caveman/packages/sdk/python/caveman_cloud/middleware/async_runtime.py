"""Explicit asynchronous API with bounded, lifecycle-owned stdlib I/O workers.

Every await is bounded by its own deadline, even while queued or when a worker is stuck. Retrieve has its
own pool, so slow recoveries never delay optimize, and receipts have theirs (one worker, sixteen queued, as in the TS
SDK), so a receipt burst never takes optimize's slots. Pools are rebuilt in a forked child.
