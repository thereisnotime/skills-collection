# Middleware conformance kit

A black-box check of any Caveman middleware runtime against the protocol in
[`docs/technical/middleware-protocol.md`](../../../../docs/technical/middleware-protocol.md).
It speaks only HTTP, so it tests `caveman-proxy`, a Postgres-backed replica set, or
another implementation the same way.

```sh
pnpm install --filter @caveman-ai/contracts   # ajv is its only dependency
node packages/shared/contracts/conformance/run.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
  --token "$CAVEMAN_AUTH_TOKEN" [--namespace N] [--foreign-token T2] [--legacy-only]
```

Output is TAP. Exit 0 means conformant, 1 a failed check, 2 bad usage, 3 ajv missing.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--token` | Runtime credential sent as `Authorization: Bearer`. Without it the runtime is assumed open: the `unauthorized` checks and its catalog entry report `# SKIP`, and the run can still pass. |
| `--namespace` | Namespace for every scope the kit creates (default `conformance`). Session ids are random per run. |
| `--foreign-token` | A second principal that may **not** use `--namespace`. Enables the cross-namespace `403 forbidden_namespace` checks, and proves a refused delete left the owner's data intact. |
| `--legacy-only` | Behave as a protocol 1.0 client only (never send `Caveman-Middleware-Features`) and hold the runtime to 1.0 obligations: `Retry-After` is not required and the stalled-body check skips, because 1.0 never delivered that answer; so do the 1.1 input-handling checks (`sessions/delete` `unsupported_version`, case-variant keys, routing before the body). Use it against a 1.0 runtime such as `bin-v1.1.7`. |

## What it checks

Every response must be JSON, match its contract schema (route schema on 200,
`middleware-error` otherwise), carry `Cache-Control: no-store` and
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and send `Retry-After` on each 429/503.

Run once per view (the 1.0 view without the features header, the 1.1 view with it):

- capabilities in both views (legacy filtering, `protocol`, all four features);
- optimize → retrieve round trip, with the original verified by sha256;
- paging, excerpt queries, `invalid_range` past the end;
- receipts and their fixed response;
- `sessions/delete` → `originals_deleted: true` and counts → `410 deleted` for
  retrieve, optimize and receipts;
- each `server_error_codes` / `legacy_conditions` entry a client can trigger
  from outside, at the status its view requires: malformed and incomplete
  bodies, unknown fields (tolerated with the header, rejected without), a key
  that differs only by case from a defined field (`invalid_request`),
  `unsupported_version` on optimize and `sessions/delete`, `unknown_capability`
  and the stale-revision rule, `not_found` (including an unknown route whose
  body is not JSON), the request and receipt payload limits, `forbidden_origin`,
  `unauthorized`, a malformed recovery binding, `not_smaller`,
  `epoch_changed`, and a stalled request body;
- `quota_exceeded` + `Retry-After`, when capabilities advertise
  `quota_requests_per_minute` (≤ 2000), the 1.0 view's 503 `capacity` for the
  same condition, and 404 for an unknown route while over quota. This runs last
  because it spends the principal's quota for the rest of the minute.

Entries that need an internal fault, a clock, or a race (`capacity`,
`deadline`, `expired`, `identity_conflict`, storage failures) are listed as
`# SKIP` with the reason, so the report always accounts for the whole catalog.

## Versioning

`KIT_VERSION` in `run.mjs` is `<protocol major>.<protocol minor>.<kit revision>`.
Expected statuses and codes come from
`packages/sdk/parity/middleware-v1_1.fixtures.json`, so the kit and the SDK
vectors cannot drift apart. A new protocol minor bumps the kit to match.
