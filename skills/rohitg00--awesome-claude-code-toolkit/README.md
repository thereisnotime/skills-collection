### Related SDKs

If you prefer a typed, npm-installable foundation for writing hooks rather than raw scripts:

- [claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/Payshak/claude-code-hooks) — TypeScript SDK with `defineHook()`, typed event payloads for all 5 hook events, response builders, and unit-testable `.handle()` method. Zero dependencies.

### Installing Hooks

```bash
cp hooks/hooks.json .claude/hooks.json
cp -r hooks/scripts/ .claude/hooks/scripts/
```

### Quick Setup with cc-safe-setup

Install 8 production-tested safety hooks in one command — destructive command blocker, branch push protection, secret leak prevention, syntax validation, and more:

```bash
npx cc-safe-setup
```

Includes `--audit` (score your setup 0-100), `--scan` (detect tech stack, recommend hooks), and `--verify` (test each hook). See [cc-safe-setup](https://github.com/yurukusa/cc-safe-setup) for details.
