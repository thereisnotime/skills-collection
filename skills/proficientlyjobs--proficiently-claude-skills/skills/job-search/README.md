**User data (at `~/.proficiently/`):**

├── resume/                       # Your resume PDF/DOCX
├── preferences.md                # Job matching rules
├── job-history.md                # Log of all jobs found
└── jobs/                         # Per-job application folders
```

## Configuration

### Matching Rules (`~/.proficiently/preferences.md`)

Customize your job preferences:

```markdown
## Target Roles
- VP Growth
- Head of Growth
- Director of Marketing

## Must-Have Criteria
- Remote or hybrid OK
- Minimum $250k+ total comp

## Dealbreakers
- Marketing agencies
- Crypto/blockchain
- >25% travel required

## Nice-to-Have
- Series B+ startup
- AI/ML focus
- B2B SaaS
```

### Updating Preferences

Just tell Claude what you want:
- *"Add fintech to my nice-to-haves"*
- *"I don't want any roles requiring relocation"*
- *"Bump my minimum salary to $300k"*

The skill will update `~/.proficiently/preferences.md` automatically.

## Job History

All jobs found are logged to `~/.proficiently/job-history.md` with:
- Date and search terms
- Job details (title, company, location, salary)
- Fit score (High/Medium/Low/Skip)
- Notes explaining the rating

This prevents showing you the same jobs twice and creates a searchable archive.

## Cron Setup

To run daily at 9am:

```bash
# Add to crontab
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 9 * * * cd ~ && claude -p '/job-search' >> ~/.claude/skills/job-search/logs/cron.log 2>&1") | crontab -
```

**Note**: Requires Chrome to be running with Claude in Chrome extension active.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission prompts interrupting cron
Ensure all permissions are in `~/.claude/settings.json` (see Installation step 3).

### Browser not responding
Make sure Chrome is running and Claude in Chrome extension is active.

### No jobs found
- Check that hiring.cafe is accessible
- Try different search terms
- Verify your matching rules aren't too restrictive
