"""
Embedding Model Evaluation Benchmark for Resume-JD Matching

Evaluates 3 embedding models on resume-to-job-description similarity tasks:
  1. all-MiniLM-L6-v2       (current baseline in ats_scorer.py)
  2. jjzha/jobbert-base-cased (domain-adapted for labor market data)
  3. BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5  (high-quality general, small footprint)

Metrics:
  - Mean cosine similarity for matching, non-matching, and partial pairs
  - Separation gap (matching_mean - non_matching_mean)
  - Discriminability (partial placed between matching and non-matching)
  - Inference time per pair (ms)
  - Model size on disk (MB)

Usage:
