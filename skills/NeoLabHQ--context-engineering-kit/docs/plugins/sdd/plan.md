# /sdd:plan - Task Refinement & Planning

Refine a draft task specification into a fully planned, implementation-ready task through multi-agent analysis, architecture synthesis, and quality-gated verification.

- Purpose - Transforms a draft task into a complete specification with architecture, implementation steps, parallelization, and verification rubrics
- Output - A refined task file moved to `.specs/tasks/todo/`, plus skill files in `.claude/skills/` and analysis files in `.specs/analysis/`

```bash
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/add-validation.feature.md [options]
```

## How It Works

### Phase 2: Parallel Analysis

Three analysis agents run **in parallel**, each with its own judge validation:

- **Phase 2a: Research** (`researcher` agent, sonnet) — Gathers relevant resources, documentation, and libraries. Creates or updates a reusable skill file in `.claude/skills/`.
- **Phase 2b: Codebase Impact Analysis** (`code-explorer` agent, sonnet) — Identifies affected files, interfaces, and integration points. Produces an analysis file in `.specs/analysis/`.
- **Phase 2c: Business Analysis** (`business-analyst` agent, opus) — Refines the task description, creates acceptance criteria, and documents user scenarios.

Each sub-phase is validated by a judge agent. All three must pass before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Architecture Synthesis

`software-architect` agent (opus) synthesizes findings from research, codebase analysis, and business analysis into an architectural overview featuring key decisions, a solution strategy, and expected file changes.

### Phase 4: Decomposition

`tech-lead` agent (opus) breaks the architecture into ordered implementation steps, including success criteria, subtasks, blockers, risks, and complexity ratings.

### Phase 5: Parallelize Steps

`team-lead` agent (opus) reorganizes implementation steps for maximum parallel execution, assigns appropriate agent types, and creates parallelization diagrams.

### Phase 6: Define Verifications

`qa-engineer` agent (opus) adds LLM-as-Judge verification sections with custom rubrics, thresholds, and verification levels (None, Single Judge, Panel of 2, or Per-Item) for each implementation step.

### Phase 7: Promote Task

Moves the refined task file from `draft/` to `todo/` and stages all generated artifacts with Git. Staging at the end allows you to make manual edits on top and use `--refine`, so the agent can diff your changes against the staged state.

## Quality Gates

Every phase includes a judge validation step using LLM-as-Judge:

- **PASS** (score >= threshold) — Phase complete; proceed to the next stage.
- **FAIL** (score < threshold) — Re-run the phase with judge feedback.
- **MAX_ITERATIONS reached** — Proceed to the next stage automatically (with a warning logged).

## Refine Mode (`--refine`)

After reviewing the generated specification, you can edit it directly and re-run the planning process with `--refine`:

1. Compares local (unstaged) changes against staged changes by default. To compare against the last commit instead, specify it explicitly (e.g., `/plan --refine compare with last commit`).
2. Identifies the earliest modified section
3. Re-runs only stages from that point onward (top-to-bottom propagation)
4. Preserves earlier stages that are unaffected
5. Supports `//` comment markers for inline feedback

You can also pass a requirement change directly: `/plan --refine <requirement change>`. The agent incorporates your change and re-runs affected stages.

| Modified Section | Re-run From Stage |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Description / Acceptance Criteria | `business analysis` (Phase 2c) |
| Architecture Overview | `architecture synthesis` (Phase 3) |
| Implementation Process / Steps | `decomposition` (Phase 4) |
| Parallelization / Dependencies | `parallelize` (Phase 5) |
| Verification sections | `verifications` (Phase 6) |

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Refine a draft task with all stages (default)
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/add-validation.feature.md

# Fast refinement — minimal stages, lower quality bar
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/quick-fix.bug.md --fast

# One-shot — business analysis + decomposition only, no judges
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/simple-task.feature.md --one-shot

# Continue from a specific stage
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/complex-feature.feature.md --continue decomposition

# High-quality refinement with human review checkpoints
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/critical-api.feature.md --target-quality 4.5 --human-in-the-loop 2,3,4,5,6

# Skip research phase (you already know the tech stack)
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/draft/my-task.feature.md --skip research

# Incremental refinement after editing the spec
/sdd:plan .specs/tasks/todo/my-task.feature.md --refine
```

## Artifacts Generated

```text
.claude/
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md               # Reusable skill document (if research stage ran)

.specs/
├── tasks/
│   ├── draft/                     # Source (now empty for this task)
│   └── todo/
│       └── <name>.<type>.md       # Complete task specification (ready for implementation)
├── analysis/
│   └── analysis-<name>.md         # Codebase impact analysis (if codebase analysis stage ran)
└── scratchpad/
    └── <hex-id>.md                # Working scratchpads (gitignored)
```

## Best Practices

- Review the generated specification before implementing — human feedback is the most effective quality lever.
- Use `--refine` after making edits instead of re-running the full workflow.
- Add `//` comment markers to lines that need clarification — agents will incorporate your feedback.
- For complex tasks, use `--human-in-the-loop` to verify architecture decisions before decomposition.
- Use `--fast` for simple, well-defined tasks where full analysis is unnecessary.
- Use `--skip research` when working with familiar technologies.
