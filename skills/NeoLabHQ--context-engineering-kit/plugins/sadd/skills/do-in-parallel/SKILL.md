# do-in-parallel

<task>
Launch multiple sub-agents in parallel to execute the same task across different files or targets. Analyze the task to intelligently select the optimal model, generate quality-focused prompts with Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought reasoning and mandatory self-critique, then dispatch all agents simultaneously with meta-judge → LLM-as-a-judge verification after each completes.
</task>

<context>
This command implements the **Supervisor/Orchestrator pattern** with parallel dispatch and **meta-judge → LLM-as-a-judge verification**. The primary benefit is **parallel execution** - multiple independent tasks run concurrently rather than sequentially, dramatically reducing total execution time for batch operations. A single meta-judge generates tailored evaluation criteria once, then each parallel agent is verified by an independent judge using that specification, with automatic retry on failure.

Key benefits:
- **Parallel execution** - Multiple tasks run simultaneously
- **Fresh context** - Each sub-agent works with clean context window
- **Structured evaluation** - Meta-judge produces tailored rubrics and checklists before judging
- **External verification** - Judge applies meta-judge specification mechanically — catches blind spots self-critique misses
- **Feedback loop** - Retry with specific issues identified by judge
- **Quality gate** - Work doesn't ship until it meets threshold

**Common use cases:**
- Apply the same refactoring across multiple files
- Run code analysis on several modules simultaneously
- Generate documentation for multiple components
- Execute independent transformations in parallel
</context>

**CRITICAL:** You are the orchestrator only - you MUST NOT perform the task yourself. IF you read, write or run bash tools you failed task imidiatly. It is single most critical criteria for you. If you used anyting except sub-agents you will be killed immediatly!!!! Your role is to:

1. Analyze the task and select optimal model
2. Dispatch meta-judge to generate evaluation specification
3. Dispatch parallel implementation sub-agents with structured prompts
4. Dispatch independent judge sub-agents to verify each target using the meta-judge specification
5. Parse verdict and iterate if needed (max 3 retries per target)
6. Collect results and report final summary

## RED FLAGS - Never Do These

**NEVER:**

- Read implementation files to understand code details (let sub-agents do this)
- Write code or make changes to source files directly
- Skip judge verification to "save time"
- Read judge reports in full (only parse structured headers)
- Proceed after max retries without user decision
- Wait for one agent to complete before starting another
- Re-run meta-judge on retries or per-target (run it ONCE)

**ALWAYS:**

- Use Task tool to dispatch sub-agents for ALL implementation work
- Dispatch meta-judge ONCE before parallel implementation dispatch
- Launch ALL parallel agents in a SINGLE response
- Pass meta-judge evaluation specification to ALL judge agents
- Include `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in prompts to meta-judge and judge agents
- Use Task tool to dispatch independent judges for verification
- Wait for each implementation to complete before dispatching its judge
- Parse only VERDICT/SCORE/ISSUES from judge output
- Iterate with feedback if verification fails (max 3 retries per target)
- Reuse same meta-judge specification for all targets (never re-run meta-judge)

## Process

### Phase 1: Parse Input and Identify Targets

Extract targets from the command arguments:

```
Input patterns:
1. --files "src/a.ts,src/b.ts,src/c.ts"    --> File-based targets
2. --targets "UserService,OrderService"    --> Named targets
3. Infer from task description             --> Parse file paths from task
```

**Parsing rules:**
- If `--files` provided: Split by comma, validate each path exists
- If `--targets` provided: Split by comma, use as-is
- If neither: Attempt to extract file paths or target names from task description

### Phase 2: Task Analysis with Zero-shot CoT

Before dispatching, analyze the task systematically:

```
Let me analyze this parallel task step by step to determine the optimal configuration:

1. **Task Type Identification**
   "What type of work is being requested across all targets?"
   - Code transformation / refactoring
   - Code analysis / review
   - Documentation generation
   - Test generation
   - Data transformation
   - Simple lookup / extraction

2. **Per-Target Complexity Assessment**
   "How complex is the work for EACH individual target?"
   - High: Requires deep understanding, architecture decisions, novel solutions
   - Medium: Standard patterns, moderate reasoning, clear approach
   - Low: Simple transformations, mechanical changes, well-defined rules

3. **Per-Target Output Size**
   "How extensive is each target's expected output?"
   - Large: Multi-section documents, comprehensive analysis
   - Medium: Focused deliverable, single component
   - Small: Brief result, minor change

4. **Independence Check**
   "Are the targets truly independent?"
   - Yes: No shared state, no cross-dependencies, order doesn't matter
   - Partial: Some shared context needed, but can run in parallel
   - No: Dependencies exist --> Use sequential execution instead
```

#### Independence Validation (REQUIRED before parallel dispatch)

Verify tasks are truly independent before proceeding:

| Check | Question | If NO |
|-------|----------|-------|
| File Independence | Do targets share files? | Cannot parallelize - files conflict |
| State Independence | Do tasks modify shared state? | Cannot parallelize - race conditions |
| Order Independence | Does execution order matter? | Cannot parallelize - sequencing required |
| Output Independence | Does any target read another's output? | Cannot parallelize - data dependency |

**Independence Checklist:**
- [ ] No target reads output from another target
- [ ] No target modifies files another target reads
- [ ] Order of completion doesn't matter
- [ ] No shared mutable state
- [ ] No database transactions spanning targets

If ANY check fails: STOP and inform user why parallelization is unsafe. Recommend `/launch-sub-agent` for sequential execution.

### Phase 3: Model and Agent Selection

Select the optimal model and specialized agent based on task analysis. **Same configuration for all parallel agents** (ensures consistent quality):

#### 3.1 Model Selection

| Task Profile | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Complex per-target** (architecture, design) | `opus` | Maximum reasoning capability per task |
| **Specialized domain** (code review, security) | `opus` | Domain expertise matters |
| **Medium complexity, large output** | `sonnet` | Good capability, cost-efficient for volume |
| **Simple transformations** (rename, format) | `haiku` | Fast, cheap, sufficient for mechanical tasks |
| **Default** (when uncertain) | `opus` | Optimize for quality over cost |

**Decision Tree:**

```
Is EACH target's task COMPLEX (architecture, novel problem, critical decision)?
|
+-- YES --> Use Opus for ALL agents
|
+-- NO --> Is task SIMPLE and MECHANICAL (rename, format, extract)?
           |
           +-- YES --> Use Haiku for ALL agents
           |
           +-- NO --> Is output LARGE but task not complex?
                      |
                      +-- YES --> Use Sonnet for ALL agents
                      |
                      +-- NO --> Use Opus for ALL agents (default)
```

#### 3.2 Specialized Agent Selection (Optional)

If the task matches a specialized domain, include the relevant agent prompt in ALL parallel agents. Specialized agents provide domain-specific best practices that improve output quality.

**Specialized Agents:** Specialized agent list depends on project and plugins that are loaded.

**Decision:** Use specialized agent when:
- Task clearly benefits from domain expertise
- Consistency across all parallel agents is important
- Task is NOT trivial (overhead not justified for simple tasks)

Skip specialized agent when:
- Task is simple/mechanical (Haiku-tier)
- No clear domain match exists
- General-purpose execution is sufficient

### Phase 3.5: Dispatch Meta-Judge

Before dispatching parallel implementation agents, dispatch a single meta-judge to generate an evaluation specification. The meta-judge produces rubrics, checklists, and scoring criteria tailored to this specific task. The SAME specification is reused for ALL per-target judge verifications.

**Meta-judge prompt template:**

```markdown
## Task

Generate an evaluation specification yaml for the following task. You will produce rubrics, checklists, and scoring criteria that a judge agent will use to evaluate the implementation artifact.

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

## User Prompt
{Original task description from user}

## Context
{Any relevant codebase context, file paths, constraints}

## Artifact Type
{code | documentation | configuration | etc.}

## Instructions
Return only the final evaluation specification YAML in your response.
```

**Dispatch:**

```
Use Task tool:
  - description: "Meta-judge: {brief task summary}"
  - prompt: {meta-judge prompt}
  - model: opus
  - subagent_type: "sadd:meta-judge"
```

Wait for meta-judge to complete before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Construct Per-Target Prompts

Build identical prompt structure for each target, customized only with target-specific details:

#### 4.1 Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prefix (REQUIRED - MUST BE FIRST)

```markdown
## Reasoning Approach

Let's think step by step.

Before taking any action, think through the problem systematically:

1. "Let me first understand what is being asked for this specific target..."
   - What is the core objective?
   - What are the explicit requirements?
   - What constraints must I respect?

2. "Let me analyze this specific target..."
   - What is the current state?
   - What patterns or conventions exist?
   - What context is relevant?

3. "Let me plan my approach..."
   - What are the concrete steps?
   - What could go wrong?
   - Is there a simpler approach?

Work through each step explicitly before implementing.
```

#### 4.2 Task Body (Customized per target)

```markdown
<task>
{Task description from $ARGUMENTS}
</task>

<target>
{Specific target for this agent: file path, component name, etc.}
</target>

<constraints>
- Work ONLY on the specified target
- Do NOT modify other files unless explicitly required
- Follow existing patterns in the target
- {Any additional constraints from context}
</constraints>

<output>
{Expected deliverable location and format}

CRITICAL: At the end of your work, provide a "Summary" section containing:
- Files modified (full paths)
- Key changes (3-5 bullet points)
- Any decisions made and rationale
- Potential concerns or follow-up needed
</output>
```

#### 4.3 Self-Critique Suffix (REQUIRED - MUST BE LAST)

```markdown
## Self-Critique Verification (MANDATORY)

Before completing, verify your work for this target. Do not submit unverified changes.

### 1. Generate Verification Questions

Create questions specific to your task and target. There examples of questions:

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Did I achieve the stated objective for this target? | Incomplete work = failed task |
| 2 | Are my changes consistent with patterns in this file/codebase? | Inconsistency creates technical debt |
| 3 | Did I introduce any regressions or break existing functionality? | Breaking changes are unacceptable |
| 4 | Are edge cases and error scenarios handled appropriately? | Edge cases cause production issues |
| 5 | Is my output clear, well-formatted, and ready for review? | Unclear output reduces value |

### 2. Answer Each Question with Evidence

For each question, provide specific evidence from your work:

[Q1] Objective Achievement:
- Required: [what was asked]
- Delivered: [what you did]
- Gap analysis: [any gaps]

[Q2] Pattern Consistency:
- Existing pattern: [observed pattern]
- My implementation: [how I followed it]
- Deviations: [any intentional deviations and why]

[Q3] Regression Check:
- Functions affected: [list]
- Tests that would catch issues: [if known]
- Confidence level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

[Q4] Edge Cases:
- Edge case 1: [scenario] - [HANDLED/NOTED]
- Edge case 2: [scenario] - [HANDLED/NOTED]

[Q5] Output Quality:
- Well-organized: [YES/NO]
- Self-documenting: [YES/NO]
- Ready for PR: [YES/NO]

### 3. Fix Issues Before Submitting

If ANY verification reveals a gap:
1. **FIX** - Address the specific issue
2. **RE-VERIFY** - Confirm the fix resolves the issue
3. **DOCUMENT** - Note what was changed and why

CRITICAL: Do not submit until ALL verification questions have satisfactory answers.
```

### Phase 5: Parallel Dispatch and Judge Verification

Launch all sub-agents simultaneously, then verify each with an independent judge using the meta-judge's evaluation specification.

```

**CRITICAL: Parallel Dispatch Pattern**

Launch ALL implementation agents in a SINGLE response. Do NOT wait for one agent to complete before starting another:

```markdown
## Dispatching 3 parallel tasks

[Task 1]
Use Task tool:
  description: "Parallel: simplify error handling in src/services/user.ts"
  prompt: [CoT prefix + task body for user.ts + critique suffix]
  model: sonnet

[Task 2]
Use Task tool:
  description: "Parallel: simplify error handling in src/services/order.ts"
  prompt: [CoT prefix + task body for order.ts + critique suffix]
  model: sonnet

[Task 3]
Use Task tool:
  description: "Parallel: simplify error handling in src/services/payment.ts"
  prompt: [CoT prefix + task body for payment.ts + critique suffix]
  model: sonnet

[All 3 tasks launched simultaneously - results collected when all complete]
```

**Parallelization Guidelines:**
- Launch ALL independent tasks in a single batch (same response)
- Do NOT wait for one task before starting another
- Do NOT make sequential Task tool calls
- Task tool handles parallelization automatically
- Results collected after all complete

**Context Isolation (IMPORTANT):**
- Pass only context relevant to each specific target
- Do NOT pass the full list of all targets to each agent
- Let sub-agents discover local patterns through file reading
- Each agent works in clean context without accumulated confusion

#### 5.2 Judge Verification Protocol

After each implementation agent completes, dispatch an **independent judge** for that target using the meta-judge's evaluation specification.

CRITICAL: Provide to the judge EXACT meta-judge's evaluation specification YAML, do not skip or add anything, do not modify it in any way, do not shorten or summarize any text in it!

**Judge prompt template:**

```markdown
You are evaluating an implementation artifact for target {target_name} against an evaluation specification produced by the meta judge.

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

## User Prompt
{Original task description from user}

## Target
{Specific target: file path or component name}

## Evaluation Specification

```yaml
{meta-judge's evaluation specification YAML}
```

## Implementation Output
{Summary section from implementation agent}
{Paths to files modified}

## Instructions

Follow your full judge process as defined in your agent instructions!

## Output

CRITICAL: You must reply with this exact structured evaluation report format in YAML at the START of your response!
```

CRITICAL: NEVER provide score threshold, in any format, including `threshold_pass` or anything different. Judge MUST not know what threshold for score is, in order to not be biased!!!

**Dispatch judge for each target:**

```
Use Task tool:
  - description: "Judge: {target name}"
  - prompt: {judge verification prompt with exact meta-judge specification YAML}
  - model: opus
  - subagent_type: "sadd:judge"
```

#### 5.3 Parse Verdict and Iterate

Parse judge output for each target (DO NOT read full report):

```
Extract from judge reply:
- VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
- SCORE: X.X/5.0
- ISSUES: List of problems (if any)
- IMPROVEMENTS: List of suggestions (if any)
```

**Decision logic per target:**

```
If score >= 4:
  -> VERDICT: PASS
  -> Mark target complete
  -> Include IMPROVEMENTS as optional enhancements

IF score >= 3.0 and all found issues are low priority, then:
  -> VERDICT: PASS
  -> Mark target complete
  -> Include IMPROVEMENTS as optional enhancements

If score < 4:
  -> VERDICT: FAIL
  -> Check retry count for this target

  If retries < 3:
    -> Dispatch retry implementation agent with judge feedback
    -> Return to judge verification with same meta-judge specification

  If retries >= 3:
    -> Mark target as failed (isolate from other targets)
    -> Do NOT proceed with more retries without user decision
```

**IMPORTANT: Failures are isolated**
- One target failing does NOT affect other targets
- Other parallel tasks continue independently
- Only the failed target is retried

#### 5.4 Retry with Feedback (If Needed)

**Retry prompt template:**

```markdown
## Retry Required for Target: {target_name}

Your previous implementation did not pass judge verification.

## Original Task
{Original task description}

## Target
{Specific target}

## Judge Feedback
VERDICT: FAIL
SCORE: {score}/5.0
ISSUES:
{list of issues from judge}

## Your Previous Changes
{files modified in previous attempt}

## Instructions
Let's fix the identified issues step by step.

1. Review each issue the judge identified
2. For each issue, determine the root cause
3. Plan the fix for each issue
4. Implement ALL fixes
5. Verify your fixes address each issue
6. Provide updated Summary section

CRITICAL: Focus on fixing the specific issues identified. Do not rewrite everything.
```

### Phase 6: Collect and Summarize Results

After all agents complete (with retries as needed), aggregate results:

```markdown
## Parallel Execution Summary

### Configuration
- **Task:** {task description}
- **Model:** {selected model}
- **Targets:** {count} items

### Results

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status | Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|
| {target_1} | {model} | {X.X}/5.0 | {0-3} | SUCCESS | {brief outcome} |
| {target_2} | {model} | {X.X}/5.0 | {0-3} | SUCCESS | {brief outcome} |
| {target_3} | {model} | {X.X}/5.0 | {3} | FAILED | {failure reason} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Overall Assessment
- **Completed:** {X}/{total}
- **Failed:** {Y}/{total}
- **Total Retries:** {sum of all retries}
- **Common patterns:** {any patterns across results}

### Verification Summary
{Aggregate judge verification results - any common issues?}

### Files Modified
- {list of all modified files}

### Failed Targets (If Any)
{For each failed target after max retries}
- **Target:** {name}
- **Final Score:** {X.X}/5.0
- **Persistent Issues:** {issues that weren't resolved}
- **Options:** Retry with guidance / Skip / Manual fix

### Next Steps
{If any failures, suggest remediation}
```

**Failure Handling:**
- Report failed tasks clearly with error details
- Successful tasks are NOT affected by failures
- Failed targets isolated after max retries
- Suggest options: provide guidance, skip, or manual fix

## Examples

### Example 1: Code Simplification Across Modules

**Input:**
```
/do-in-parallel "Simplify error handling to use early returns instead of nested if-else" \
  --files "src/services/user.ts,src/services/order.ts,src/services/payment.ts"
```

**Analysis:**
- Task type: Code transformation / refactoring
- Per-target complexity: Medium (pattern-based transformation)
- Output size: Medium (modified file)
- Independence: Yes (separate files, no cross-dependencies)

**Model Selection:** Sonnet (pattern-based, medium complexity)

**Execution:**

```
Phase 3.5: Dispatch Meta-Judge (ONCE)
  Meta-judge (Opus)...
    → Generated evaluation specification YAML
    → 3 rubric dimensions, 5 checklist items

Phase 5: Parallel Dispatch
  [All 3 implementation agents launched simultaneously]

  Target: user.ts
    Implementation (Sonnet)...
      -> Converted 4 nested if-else blocks to early returns
    Judge Verification (Opus, with meta-judge spec)...
      -> VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.2/5.0
      -> IMPROVEMENTS: Consider extracting complex conditions

  Target: order.ts
    Implementation (Sonnet)...
      -> Converted 6 nested if-else blocks to early returns
    Judge Verification (Opus, with meta-judge spec)...
      -> VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.0/5.0
      -> ISSUES: None

  Target: payment.ts
    Implementation (Sonnet)...
      -> Converted 3 nested if-else blocks
    Judge Verification (Opus, with meta-judge spec)...
      -> VERDICT: FAIL, SCORE: 3.2/5.0
      -> ISSUES: Missing edge case for null amount
    Retry Implementation (Sonnet)...
      -> Added null check for payment amount
    Judge Verification (Opus, with same meta-judge spec)...
      -> VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.1/5.0
```

**Result:**
```markdown
## Parallel Execution Summary

### Configuration
- **Task:** Simplify error handling to use early returns
- **Model:** Sonnet
- **Targets:** 3 files

### Results

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status | Summary |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|
| src/services/user.ts | sonnet | 4.2/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS | Converted 4 nested if-else blocks |
| src/services/order.ts | sonnet | 4.0/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS | Converted 6 nested if-else blocks |
| src/services/payment.ts | sonnet | 4.1/5.0 | 1 | SUCCESS | Converted 3 blocks, added null check |

### Overall Assessment
- **Completed:** 3/3
- **Total Retries:** 1
- **Total Agents:** 9 (1 meta-judge + 3 implementations + 1 retry + 4 judges)
- **Common patterns:** All files followed consistent early return pattern
```

### Example 2: Documentation Generation

**Input:**
```
/do-in-parallel "Generate JSDoc documentation for all public methods" \
  --files "src/api/users.ts,src/api/products.ts,src/api/orders.ts,src/api/auth.ts"
```

**Analysis:**
- Task type: Documentation generation
- Per-target complexity: Low (mechanical documentation)
- Output size: Medium (inline comments)
- Independence: Yes

**Model Selection:** Haiku (mechanical, well-defined rules)

**Dispatch:** 1 meta-judge + 4 parallel agents

**Execution Summary:**

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| src/api/users.ts | haiku | 4.0/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| src/api/products.ts | haiku | 3.8/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |

### Example 3: Security Analysis

**Input:**
```
/do-in-parallel "Analyze for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and suggest fixes" \
  --files "src/db/queries.ts,src/db/migrations.ts,src/api/search.ts"
```

**Analysis:**
- Task type: Security analysis
- Per-target complexity: High (security requires careful analysis)
- Output size: Medium (analysis report + suggestions)
- Independence: Yes

**Model Selection:** Opus (security-critical, requires deep analysis)

**Dispatch:** 1 meta-judge + 3 parallel agents

**Execution Summary:**

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| src/db/queries.ts | opus | 4.5/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| src/db/migrations.ts | opus | 4.3/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| src/api/search.ts | opus | 4.0/5.0 | 1 | SUCCESS |

Total Agents: 8 (1 meta-judge + 3 implementations + 1 retry + 3 judges)

### Example 4: Test Generation with Partial Failure

**Input:**
```
/do-in-parallel "Generate unit tests achieving 80% coverage" \
  --targets "UserService,OrderService,PaymentService,NotificationService"
```

**Analysis:**
- Task type: Test generation
- Per-target complexity: Medium (follow testing patterns)
- Output size: Large (multiple test files)
- Independence: Yes (separate services)

**Model Selection:** Sonnet (pattern-based, extensive output)

**Dispatch:** 1 meta-judge + 4 parallel agents

**Execution:**

```
Phase 3.5: Meta-judge (Opus)
  → Generated evaluation specification YAML
  → 4 rubric dimensions, 7 checklist items

Target: UserService
  -> Judge (Opus, with meta-judge spec): PASS, 4.3/5.0

Target: OrderService
  -> Judge (Opus, with meta-judge spec): FAIL, 3.2/5.0 (missing edge cases)
  -> Retry: Judge (Opus, same meta-judge spec): PASS, 4.0/5.0

Target: PaymentService
  -> Judge (Opus, with meta-judge spec): FAIL, 2.8/5.0 (wrong mock patterns)
  -> Retry 1: Judge (Opus, same meta-judge spec): FAIL, 3.0/5.0 (still missing scenarios)
  -> Retry 2: Judge (Opus, same meta-judge spec): FAIL, 3.1/5.0 (coverage only 65%)
  -> Retry 3: Judge (Opus, same meta-judge spec): FAIL, 3.2/5.0 (coverage at 72%)
  -> MARKED FAILED after max retries

Target: NotificationService
  -> Judge (Opus, with meta-judge spec): PASS, 4.1/5.0
```

**Result:**

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| UserService | sonnet | 4.3/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| OrderService | sonnet | 4.0/5.0 | 1 | SUCCESS |
| PaymentService | sonnet | 3.2/5.0 | 3 | FAILED |
| NotificationService | sonnet | 4.1/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |

**Overall:** 3/4 completed, 1 failed

**Escalation for PaymentService:**
```markdown
### Failed Target: PaymentService
- **Final Score:** 3.2/5.0
- **Persistent Issues:**
  - Test coverage at 72%, target is 80%
  - Complex async scenarios not fully covered
- **Options:**
  1. Provide guidance on specific async patterns to test
  2. Accept 72% coverage as sufficient
  3. Manual test writing for complex scenarios
```

### Example 5: Inferred Targets from Task

**Input:**
```
/do-in-parallel "Apply consistent logging format to src/handlers/user.ts, src/handlers/order.ts, and src/handlers/product.ts"
```

**Analysis:**
- Targets inferred: 3 files extracted from task description
- Task type: Code transformation
- Complexity: Low
- Independence: Yes

**Model Selection:** Haiku (simple, mechanical)

**Dispatch:** 1 meta-judge + 3 parallel agents

**Execution Summary:**

| Target | Model | Judge Score | Retries | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| src/handlers/user.ts | haiku | 4.2/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| src/handlers/order.ts | haiku | 4.0/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |
| src/handlers/product.ts | haiku | 4.1/5.0 | 0 | SUCCESS |

## Best Practices

### Target Selection

- **Be specific:** List exact files when possible
- **Use globs carefully:** Review expanded list before confirming
- **Limit scope:** 10-15 targets max per batch for manageability
- **Group by similarity:** Similar targets benefit from consistent patterns

### Model Selection Guidelines

| Scenario | Model | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Security analysis | Opus | Critical reasoning required |
| Architecture decisions | Opus | Quality over speed |
| Simple refactoring | Haiku | Fast, sufficient |
| Documentation generation | Haiku | Mechanical task |
| Code review per file | Sonnet | Balanced capability |
| Test generation | Sonnet | Extensive but patterned |

### Meta-Judge + Judge Verification

- **Never skip meta-judge** - Tailored evaluation criteria produce better judgments than generic ones
- **Reuse meta-judge spec across all targets** - The evaluation specification stays constant; only the implementation changes
- **Parse only headers from judge** - Don't read full reports to avoid context pollution
- **Include CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT** - Both meta-judge and judge need the resolved plugin root path
- **Meta-judge YAML** - Pass only the meta-judge YAML to the judge, do not add any additional text or comments to it!

### Judge Selection

| Implementation Model | Judge Model | Rationale |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Opus | Opus | Critical work needs strong verification |
| Sonnet | Opus | Tailored evaluation requires strong reasoning |
| Haiku | Opus | Verify simple work with strong evaluation |

**Guideline:** Judges always use Opus for consistent, high-quality evaluation across all targets.

### Context Isolation

- **Minimal context:** Each sub-agent gets only what it needs
- **No cross-references:** Don't tell Agent A about Agent B's target
- **Let them discover:** Sub-agents read files to understand patterns
- **File system as truth:** Changes are coordinated through the filesystem

### Quality Assurance

- **Three-layer verification:** Self-critique (internal) + Meta-judge specification (structured) + Judge (external)
- **Self-critique first:** Implementation agents verify own work before submission
- **Meta-judge specification:** Tailored rubrics ensure consistent, relevant evaluation criteria
- **External judge second:** Independent judge applies meta-judge specification mechanically — catches blind spots self-critique misses
- **Iteration loop:** Retry with feedback until passing or max retries
- **Isolated failures:** One target failing doesn't affect others
- **Review the summary:** Check for failed or partial completions
- **Run tests after:** Parallel changes may have subtle interactions
- **Commit atomically:** All changes from one batch = one commit

#### Error Handling

| Failure Type | Description | Recovery Action |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Recoverable** | Judge found issues, retry available | Retry with judge feedback (max 3 per target) |
| **Approach Failure** | The approach for this target is wrong | Escalate to user with options |
| **Foundation Issue** | Requirements unclear or impossible | Escalate to user for clarification |
| **Max Retries Exceeded** | Target failed after 3 retries | Mark failed, continue other targets, report at end |

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER continue past max retries without user input
- NEVER try to "fix forward" without addressing judge issues
- NEVER skip judge verification
- STOP and report if context is missing (don't guess)
- ISOLATE failures - one target failing doesn't stop others
