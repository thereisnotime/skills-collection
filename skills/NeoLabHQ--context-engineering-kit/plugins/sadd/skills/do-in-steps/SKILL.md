# do-in-steps

<task>
Execute a complex task by decomposing it into sequential subtasks and orchestrating sub-agents to complete each step in order. Automatically analyze the task to identify dependencies, select optimal models for each subtask, pass relevant context from completed steps to subsequent ones, and verify each step with an independent judge (using a meta-judge evaluation specification) before proceeding.
</task>

<context>
This command implements the **Supervisor/Orchestrator pattern** for sequential task execution with context passing and **meta-judge → LLM-as-a-judge verification**. You (the orchestrator) analyze a complex task, decompose it into ordered subtasks, then for each step dispatch a meta-judge AND implementation agent **in parallel**. The meta-judge generates step-specific evaluation criteria while the implementation runs concurrently. Each sub-agent receives:
- **Isolated context** - Clean context window for its specific subtask
- **Optimal model** - Selected based on subtask complexity (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- **Previous step context** - Summary of relevant outputs from preceding steps
- **Structured reasoning** - Zero-shot CoT prefix for systematic thinking
- **Self-critique** - Internal verification before submission
- **Structured evaluation** - Meta-judge produces tailored rubrics and checklists per step before judging occurs
- **External judge** - LLM-as-a-judge verification using meta-judge specification with iteration loop
- **Parallel speed** - Meta-judge and implementation agent run in parallel per step; meta-judge specification reused across retries within that step

</context>

**CRITICAL:** You are the orchestrator only - you MUST NOT perform the task yourself. IF you read, write or run bash tools you failed task imidiatly. It is single most critical criteria for you. If you used anyting except sub-agents you will be killed immediatly!!!! Your role is to:

1. Analyze and decompose the task
2. Select optimal models and agents for each subtask
3. **For each step: dispatch meta-judge AND implementation agent in parallel** (meta-judge FIRST in dispatch order)
4. **Wait for BOTH to complete, then dispatch judge with meta-judge's specification**
5. **Iterate if judge fails the step (max 3 retries), reusing same meta-judge specification**
6. Collect outputs and pass context forward
7. Report final results

## RED FLAGS - Never Do These

**NEVER:**

- Read implementation files to understand code details (let sub-agents do this)
- Write code or make changes to source files directly
- Skip decomposition and jump to implementation
- Perform multiple steps yourself "to save time"
- Overflow your context by reading step outputs in detail
- Read judge reports in full (only parse structured headers)
- Skip judge verification and proceed next step
- Provide score threshold to the judge in any format

**ALWAYS:**

- Use Task tool to dispatch sub-agents for ALL implementation work
- Dispatch meta-judge AND implementation agent **in parallel per step** (meta-judge FIRST in dispatch order)
- Wait for BOTH meta-judge and implementation to complete before dispatching judge
- Pass step's meta-judge evaluation specification to the judge agent
- Include `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in prompts to meta-judge and judge agents
- Reuse same meta-judge specification across retries within a step (never re-run meta-judge for retries)
- Dispatch a NEW meta-judge for each new step (each step gets its own tailored specification)
- Use Task tool to dispatch **independent judges** for step verification
- Pass only necessary context summaries, not full file contents
- Get pass from judge verification before proceeding to next step
- Iterate with judge feedback if verification fails (max 3 retries)

Any deviation from orchestration (attempting to implement subtasks yourself, reading implementation files, reading full judge reports, or making direct changes) will result in context pollution and ultimate failure, as a result you will be fired!

## Process

### Setup: Create Reports Directory

Before starting, ensure the reports directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p .specs/reports
```

**Report naming convention:** `.specs/reports/{task-name}-step-{N}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

Where:

- `{task-name}` - Derived from task description (e.g., `user-dto-refactor`)
- `{N}` - Step number
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` - Current date

**Note:** Implementation outputs go to their specified locations; only judge verification reports go to `.specs/reports/`

### Phase 1: Task Analysis and Decomposition

Analyze the task systematically using Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

```
Let me analyze this task step by step to decompose it into sequential subtasks:

1. **Task Understanding**
   "What is the overall objective?"
   - What is being asked?
   - What is the expected final outcome?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Identify Natural Boundaries**
   "Where does the work naturally divide?"
   - Database/model changes (foundation)
   - Interface/contract changes (dependencies)
   - Implementation changes (core work)
   - Integration/caller updates (ripple effects)
   - Testing/validation (verification)
   - Documentation (finalization)

3. **Dependency Identification**
   "What must happen before what?"
   - "If I do B before A, will B break or use stale information?"
   - "Does B need any output from A as input?"
   - "Would doing B first require redoing work after A?"
   - What is the minimal viable ordering?

4. **Define Clear Boundaries**
   "What exactly does each subtask encompass?"
   - Input: What does this step receive?
   - Action: What transformation/change does it make?
   - Output: What does this step produce?
   - Verification: How do we know it succeeded?
```

**Decomposition Guidelines:**

| Pattern | Decomposition Strategy | Example |
|---------|------------------------|---------|
| Interface change | 1. Update interface, 2. Update implementations, 3. Update consumers | "Change return type of getUser" |
| Feature addition | 1. Add core logic, 2. Add integration points, 3. Add API layer | "Add caching to UserService" |
| Refactoring | 1. Extract/modify core, 2. Update internal references, 3. Update external references | "Extract helper class from Service" |
| Bug fix with impact | 1. Fix root cause, 2. Fix dependent issues, 3. Update tests | "Fix calculation error affecting reports" |
| Multi-layer change | 1. Data layer, 2. Business layer, 3. API layer, 4. Client layer | "Add new field to User entity" |

**Decomposition Output Format:**

```markdown
## Task Decomposition

### Original Task
{task_description}

### Subtasks (Sequential Order)

| Step | Subtask | Depends On | Complexity | Type | Output |
|------|---------|------------|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | - | {low/med/high} | {type} | {what it produces} |
| 2 | {description} | Step 1 | {low/med/high} | {type} | {what it produces} |
| 3 | {description} | Steps 1,2 | {low/med/high} | {type} | {what it produces} |
...

### Dependency Graph
Step 1 ─→ Step 2 ─→ Step 3 ─→ ...
```

### Phase 2: Model Selection for Each Subtask

For each subtask, analyze and select the optimal model:

```
Let me determine the optimal configuration for each subtask:

For Subtask N:
1. **Complexity Assessment**
   "How complex is the reasoning required?"
   - High: Architecture decisions, novel problem-solving, critical logic changes
   - Medium: Standard patterns, moderate refactoring, API updates
   - Low: Simple transformations, straightforward updates, documentation

2. **Scope Assessment**
   "How extensive is the work?"
   - Large: Multiple files, complex interactions
   - Medium: Single component, focused changes
   - Small: Minor modifications, single file

3. **Risk Assessment**
   "What is the impact of errors?"
   - High: Breaking changes, security-sensitive, data integrity
   - Medium: Internal changes, reversible modifications
   - Low: Non-critical utilities, documentation

4. **Domain Expertise Check**
   "Does this match a specialized agent profile?"
   - Development: implementation, refactoring, bug fixes
   - Architecture: system design, pattern selection
   - Documentation: API docs, comments, README updates
   - Testing: test generation, test updates
```

**Model Selection Matrix:**

| Complexity | Scope | Risk | Recommended Model |
|------------|-------|------|-------------------|
| High | Any | Any | `opus` |
| Any | Any | High | `opus` |
| Medium | Large | Medium | `opus` |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | `sonnet` |
| Medium | Small | Low | `sonnet` |
| Low | Any | Low | `haiku` |

**Decision Tree per Subtask:**

```
Is this subtask CRITICAL (architecture, interface, breaking changes)?
|
+-- YES --> Use Opus (highest capability for critical work)
|           |
|           +-- Does it match a specialized domain?
|               +-- YES --> Include specialized agent prompt
|               +-- NO --> Use Opus alone
|
+-- NO --> Is this subtask COMPLEX but not critical?
           |
           +-- YES --> Use Sonnet (balanced capability/cost)
           |
           +-- NO --> Is output LONG but task not complex?
                      |
                      +-- YES --> Use Sonnet (handles length well)
                      |
                      +-- NO --> Is this subtask SIMPLE/MECHANICAL?
                                 |
                                 +-- YES --> Use Haiku (fast, cheap)
                                 |
                                 +-- NO --> Use Sonnet (default for uncertain)
```

**Specialized Agent:** Specialized agent list depends on project and plugins that are loaded. Common agents from the `sdd` plugin include: `sdd:developer`, `sdd:tdd-developer`, `sdd:researcher`, `sdd:software-architect`, `sdd:tech-lead`, `sdd:team-lead`, `sdd:qa-engineer`. If the appropriate specialized agent is not available, fallback to a general agent without specialization.

**Decision:** Use specialized agent when subtask clearly benefits from domain expertise AND complexity justifies the overhead (not for Haiku-tier tasks).

**Selection Output Format:**

```markdown
## Model/Agent Selection

| Step | Subtask | Model | Agent | Rationale |
|------|---------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Update interface | opus | sdd:developer | Complex API design |
| 2 | Update implementations | sonnet | sdd:developer | Follow patterns |
| 3 | Update callers | haiku | - | Simple find/replace |
| 4 | Update tests | sonnet | sdd:tdd-developer | Test expertise |
```

### Phase 3: Sequential Execution with Parallel Meta-Judge and Judge Verification

Execute subtasks one by one. For each step, dispatch a meta-judge AND implementation agent **in parallel**, then verify with an independent judge using the meta-judge's specification. Iterate if needed, then pass context forward.

**Execution Flow per Step:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step N                                                                       │

```

#### 3.1 Context Passing Protocol

After each subtask completes, extract relevant context for subsequent steps:

**Context to pass forward:**

- Files modified (paths only, not contents)
- Key changes made (summary)
- New interfaces/APIs introduced
- Decisions made that affect later steps
- Warnings or considerations for subsequent steps

**Context filtering:**

- Pass ONLY information relevant to remaining subtasks
- Do NOT pass implementation details that don't affect later steps
- Keep context summaries concise (max 200 words per step)

**Context Size Guideline:** If cumulative context exceeds ~500 words, summarize older steps more aggressively. Sub-agents can read files directly if they need details.

**Example of Context Accumulation (Concrete):**

```markdown
## Completed Steps Summary

### Step 1: Define UserRepository Interface
- **What was done:** Created `src/repositories/UserRepository.ts` with interface definition
- **Key outputs:**
  - Interface: `IUserRepository` with methods: `findById`, `findByEmail`, `create`, `update`, `delete`
  - Types: `UserCreateInput`, `UserUpdateInput` in `src/types/user.ts`
- **Relevant for next steps:**
  - Implementation must fulfill `IUserRepository` interface
  - Use the defined input types for method signatures

### Step 2: Implement UserRepository
- **What was done:** Created `src/repositories/UserRepositoryImpl.ts` implementing `IUserRepository`
- **Key outputs:**
  - Class: `UserRepositoryImpl` with all interface methods implemented
  - Uses existing database connection from `src/db/connection.ts`
- **Relevant for next steps:**
  - Import repository from `src/repositories/UserRepositoryImpl`
  - Constructor requires `DatabaseConnection` injection
```

#### 3.2 Sub-Agent Prompt Construction

For each subtask, construct the prompt with these mandatory components:

##### 3.2.1 Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prefix (REQUIRED - MUST BE FIRST)

```markdown
## Reasoning Approach

Before taking any action, think through this subtask systematically.

Let's approach this step by step:

1. "Let me understand what was done in previous steps..."
   - What context am I building on?
   - What interfaces/patterns were established?
   - What constraints did previous steps introduce?

2. "Let me understand what this step requires..."
   - What is the specific objective?
   - What are the boundaries of this step?
   - What must I NOT change (preserve from previous steps)?

3. "Let me plan my approach..."
   - What specific modifications are needed?
   - What order should I make them?
   - What could go wrong?

4. "Let me verify my approach before implementing..."
   - Does my plan achieve the objective?
   - Am I consistent with previous steps' changes?
   - Is there a simpler way?

Work through each step explicitly before implementing.
```

##### 3.2.2 Task Body

```markdown
<task>
{Subtask description}
</task>

<subtask_context>
Step {N} of {total_steps}: {subtask_name}
</subtask_context>

<previous_steps_context>
{Summary of relevant outputs from previous steps - ONLY if this is not the first step}
- Step 1: {what was done, key files modified, relevant decisions}
- Step 2: {what was done, key files modified, relevant decisions}
...
</previous_steps_context>

<constraints>
- Focus ONLY on this specific subtask
- Build upon (do not undo) changes from previous steps
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Produce output that subsequent steps can build upon
</constraints>

<input>
{What this subtask receives - files, context, dependencies}
</input>

<output>
{Expected deliverable - modified files, new files, summary of changes}

CRITICAL: At the end of your work, provide a "Context for Next Steps" section with:
- Files modified (full paths)
- Key changes summary (3-5 bullet points)
- Any decisions that affect later steps
- Warnings or considerations for subsequent steps
</output>
```

##### 3.2.3 Self-Critique Suffix (REQUIRED - MUST BE LAST)

```markdown
## Self-Critique Verification (MANDATORY)

Before completing, verify your work integrates properly with previous steps. Do not submit unverified changes.

### Verification Questions

Generate verification questions based on the subtask description and the previous steps context. Examples:

| # | Question | Evidence Required |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Does my work build correctly on previous step outputs? | [Specific evidence] |
| 2 | Did I maintain consistency with established patterns/interfaces? | [Specific evidence] |
| 3 | Does my solution address ALL requirements for this step? | [Specific evidence] |
| 4 | Did I stay within my scope (not modifying unrelated code)? | [List any out-of-scope changes] |
| 5 | Is my output ready for the next step to build upon? | [Check against dependency graph] |

### Answer Each Question with Evidence

Examine your solution and provide specific evidence for each question:

[Q1] Previous Step Integration:
- Previous step output: [relevant context received]
- How I built upon it: [specific integration]
- Any conflicts: [resolved or flagged]

[Q2] Pattern Consistency:
- Patterns established: [list]
- How I followed them: [evidence]
- Any deviations: [justified or fixed]

[Q3] Requirement Completeness:
- Required: [what was asked]
- Delivered: [what you did]
- Gap analysis: [any gaps]

[Q4] Scope Adherence:
- In-scope changes: [list]
- Out-of-scope changes: [none, or justified]

[Q5] Output Readiness:
- What later steps need: [based on decomposition]
- What I provided: [specific outputs]
- Completeness: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Revise If Needed

If ANY verification question reveals a gap:
1. **FIX** - Address the specific gap identified
2. **RE-VERIFY** - Confirm the fix resolves the issue
3. **UPDATE** - Update the "Context for Next Steps" section

CRITICAL: Do not submit until ALL verification questions have satisfactory answers.
```

#### 3.3 Parallel Meta-Judge Dispatch

**CRITICAL**: For each step, dispatch the meta-judge AND implementation agent **in parallel in a single message** with two Task tool calls. The meta-judge MUST be the first tool call in the message so it can observe artifacts before the implementation agent modifies them.

Both agents run as **foreground** agents. Wait for BOTH to complete before proceeding to judge dispatch.

**Meta-Judge Prompt (per step):**

```markdown
## Task

Generate an evaluation specification yaml for the following step. You will produce rubrics, checklists, and scoring criteria that a judge agent will use to evaluate the implementation artifact.

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

## User Prompt
{Original task description from user}

## Step Being Evaluated
Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}
{subtask_description}
- Input: {what this step receives}
- Expected output: {what this step should produce}

## Previous Steps Context
{Summary of what previous steps accomplished}

## Artifact Type
{code | documentation | configuration | etc.}

## Instructions
Return only the final evaluation specification YAML in your response.
```

**Dispatch Example**

Send BOTH Task tool calls in a single message. Meta-judge first, implementation second:

```
Message with 2 tool calls:
  Tool call 1 (meta-judge):
    - description: "Meta-judge Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
    - model: opus
    - subagent_type: "sadd:meta-judge"

  Tool call 2 (implementation):
    - description: "Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
    - model: {selected model}
    - subagent_type: "{selected agent type}"
```

Wait for BOTH to return before proceeding to judge dispatch.

#### 3.4 Judge Verification Protocol

After BOTH meta-judge and implementation agent complete, dispatch an **independent judge** to verify the step using the meta-judge evaluation specification.

CRITICAL: Provide to the judge EXACT meta-judge's evaluation specification YAML, do not skip or add anything, do not modify it in any way, do not shorten or summarize any text in it!

**Prompt template for step judge:**

```markdown
You are evaluating Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name} against an evaluation specification produced by the meta judge.

CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

## Original Task
{overall_task_description}

## Step Requirements
{subtask_description}
- Input: {what this step receives}
- Expected output: {what this step should produce}

## Previous Steps Context
{Summary of what previous steps accomplished}

## Evaluation Specification

```yaml
{meta-judge's evaluation specification YAML}
```

## Implementation Output
{Path to files modified by implementation agent}
{Context for Next Steps section from implementation agent}

## Instructions

Follow your full judge process as defined in your agent instructions!

## Output

CRITICAL: You must reply with this exact structured evaluation report format in YAML at the START of your response!
```

CRITICAL: NEVER provide score threshold, in any format, including `threshold_pass` or anything different. Judge MUST not know what threshold for score is, in order to not be biased!!!

**Dispatch:**

```
Use Task tool:
  - description: "Judge Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
  - prompt: {judge verification prompt with exact meta-judge specification YAML}
  - model: opus
  - subagent_type: "sadd:judge"
```

#### 3.5 Dispatch, Verify, and Iterate

For each subtask in sequence:

```
1. Dispatch meta-judge AND implementation agent IN PARALLEL (single message, 2 tool calls):
   Tool call 1 (meta-judge — MUST be first):
     Use Task tool:
       - description: "Meta-judge Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
       - prompt: {meta-judge prompt with step requirements and context}
       - model: opus
       - subagent_type: "sadd:meta-judge"

   Tool call 2 (implementation):
     Use Task tool:
       - description: "Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
       - prompt: {constructed prompt with CoT + task + previous context + self-critique}
       - model: {selected model for this subtask}
       - subagent_type: "{selected agent type}"

2. Wait for BOTH to complete. Collect outputs:
   - From meta-judge: Extract evaluation specification YAML
   - From implementation: Parse "Context for Next Steps" section, note files modified

3. Dispatch judge sub-agent (with this step's meta-judge specification):
   Use Task tool:
     - description: "Judge Step {N}/{total}: {subtask_name}"
     - prompt: {judge verification prompt with step requirements, implementation output, and meta-judge specification YAML}
     - model: opus
     - subagent_type: "sadd:judge"

4. Parse judge verdict (DO NOT read full report):
   Extract from judge reply:
   - VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
   - SCORE: X.X/5.0
   - ISSUES: List of problems (if any)
   - IMPROVEMENTS: List of suggestions (if any)

5. Decision based on verdict:

   If score ≥4.0:
     → VERDICT: PASS
     → Proceed to next step with accumulated context
     → Include IMPROVEMENTS in context as optional enhancements

   IF score ≥ 3.0 and all found issues are low priority, then:
     → VERDICT: PASS
     → Proceed to next step with accumulated context
     → Include IMPROVEMENTS in context as optional enhancements

   If score <4.0:
     → VERDICT: FAIL
     → Check retry count for this step

     If retries < 3:
       → Dispatch retry implementation agent with:
         - Original step requirements
         - Judge's ISSUES list as feedback
         - Path to judge report for details
         - Instruction to fix specific issues
       → Return to judge verification with SAME meta-judge specification from this step
       → Do NOT re-run meta-judge for retries

     If retries ≥ 3:
       → Escalate to user (see Error Handling)
       → Do NOT proceed to next step

6. Proceed to next subtask with accumulated context
   → Next step gets a NEW meta-judge dispatched in parallel with its implementation agent
```

**Retry prompt template for implementation agent:**

```markdown
## Retry Required: Step {N}/{total}

Your previous implementation did not pass judge verification.

<original_requirements>
{subtask_description}
</original_requirements>

<judge_feedback>
VERDICT: FAIL
SCORE: {score}/5.0
ISSUES:
{list of issues from judge}

Full report available at: {path_to_judge_report}
</judge_feedback>

<your_previous_output>
{files modified in previous attempt}
</your_previous_output>

Instructions:
Let's fix the identified issues step by step.

1. First, review each issue the judge identified
2. For each issue, determine the root cause
3. Plan the fix for each issue
4. Implement ALL fixes
5. Verify your fixes address each issue
6. Provide updated "Context for Next Steps" section

CRITICAL: Focus on fixing the specific issues identified. Do not rewrite everything.
```

### Meta-Judge Specifications
One evaluation specification generated per step (in parallel with implementation), reused across retries within each step.


### Follow-up Recommendations
{Any improvements suggested by judges, tests to run, or manual verification needed}
```

## Error Handling

### If Judge Verification Fails (Score <4.0)

The judge-verified iteration loop handles most failures automatically:

```
Judge FAIL (Retry Available):
  1. Parse ISSUES from judge verdict
  2. Dispatch retry implementation agent with feedback
  3. Re-verify with judge (using same step's meta-judge specification — do NOT re-run meta-judge)
  4. Repeat until PASS or max retries (3)
```

### If Step Fails After Max Retries

When a step fails judge verification three times:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with broken foundation
2. **Report** - Provide failure analysis:
   - Original step requirements
   - All judge verdicts and scores
   - Persistent issues across retries
3. **Escalate** - Present options to user:
   - Provide additional context/guidance for retry
   - Modify step requirements
   - Skip step (if optional)
   - Abort and report partial progress
4. **Wait** - Do NOT proceed without user decision

**Escalation Report Format:**

```markdown
## Step {N} Failed Verification (Max Retries Exceeded)

### Step Requirements
{subtask_description}

### Verification History
| Attempt | Score | Key Issues |
|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | {X.X}/5.0 | {issues} |
| 2 | {X.X}/5.0 | {issues} |
| 3 | {X.X}/5.0 | {issues} |
| 4 | {X.X}/5.0 | {issues} |

### Persistent Issues
{Issues that appeared in multiple attempts}

### Judge Reports
- .specs/reports/{task-name}-step-{N}-attempt-1.md
- .specs/reports/{task-name}-step-{N}-attempt-2.md
- .specs/reports/{task-name}-step-{N}-attempt-3.md
- .specs/reports/{task-name}-step-{N}-attempt-4.md

### Options
1. **Provide guidance** - Give additional context for another retry
2. **Modify requirements** - Simplify or clarify step requirements
3. **Skip step** - Mark as skipped and continue (if non-critical)
4. **Abort** - Stop execution and preserve partial progress

Awaiting your decision...
```

**Never:**

- Continue past a failed step after max retries
- Skip judge verification to "save time"
- Ignore persistent issues across retries
- Make assumptions about what might have worked

### If Context is Missing

1. **Do NOT guess** what previous steps produced
2. **Re-examine** previous step output for missing information
3. **Check judge reports** - they may have noted missing elements
4. **Dispatch clarification sub-agent** if needed to extract missing context
5. **Update context passing** for future similar tasks

### If Steps Conflict

1. **Stop execution** at conflict point
2. **Analyze:** Was decomposition incorrect? Are steps actually dependent?
3. **Check judge feedback** - judges may have flagged integration issues
4. **Options:**
   - Re-order steps if dependency was missed
   - Combine conflicting steps into one
   - Add reconciliation step between conflicting steps

## Examples

### Example 1: Interface Change with Consumer Updates

**Input:**

```
/do-in-steps Change the return type of UserService.getUser() from User to UserDTO and update all consumers
```

**Phase 1 - Decomposition:**

| 2 | Update Service | opus | sdd:developer | High risk, core service change |
| 3 | Update Controller | sonnet | sdd:developer | Medium complexity, follows patterns |
| 4 | Update Tests | sonnet | sdd:tdd-developer | Test expertise |

**Phase 3 - Execution with Parallel Meta-Judge and Judge Verification:**

```
Step 1: Create UserDTO
  Parallel dispatch (single message, 2 tool calls):
    Tool call 1 — Meta-judge (Opus, sadd:meta-judge)...
      → Generated step-specific evaluation specification YAML
    Tool call 2 — Implementation (Sonnet, sdd:developer)...
      → Created UserDTO.ts with id, name, email, createdAt fields
  Judge Verification (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 1 meta-judge spec)...
    → VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.2/5.0
    → IMPROVEMENTS: Consider adding validation methods
  → Context passed: UserDTO interface, file path

Step 2: Update UserService (First Attempt Failed)
  Parallel dispatch (single message, 2 tool calls):
    Tool call 1 — Meta-judge (Opus, sadd:meta-judge)...
      → Generated step-specific evaluation specification YAML
    Tool call 2 — Implementation (Opus, sdd:developer)...
      → Updated return type but missed mapping logic
  Judge Verification (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 2 meta-judge spec)...
    → VERDICT: FAIL, SCORE: 2.8/5.0
    → ISSUES: Missing User->UserDTO mapping, return type changed but still returns User
  Retry Implementation (Opus) with judge feedback...
    → Added static fromUser() factory method
    → Updated getUser() to use mapping
  Judge Verification (Opus, sadd:judge, same step 2 meta-judge spec)...
    → VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.5/5.0
  → Context passed: Method signature changed, mapping pattern used

Step 3: Update UserController
  Parallel dispatch (single message, 2 tool calls):
    Tool call 1 — Meta-judge (Opus, sadd:meta-judge)...
      → Generated step-specific evaluation specification YAML
    Tool call 2 — Implementation (Sonnet, sdd:developer)...
      → Updated controller to expect UserDTO
  Judge Verification (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 3 meta-judge spec)...
    → VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.0/5.0
  → Context passed: Endpoint contracts updated

Step 4: Update Tests
  Parallel dispatch (single message, 2 tool calls):
    Tool call 1 — Meta-judge (Opus, sadd:meta-judge)...
      → Generated step-specific evaluation specification YAML
    Tool call 2 — Implementation (Sonnet, sdd:tdd-developer)...
      → Updated service and controller tests
  Judge Verification (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 4 meta-judge spec)...
    → VERDICT: PASS, SCORE: 4.3/5.0
  → All steps complete
```

**Final Summary:**

- Total Agents: 13 (4 meta-judges + 4 implementations + 1 retry + 4 judges)
- Steps with Retries: Step 2 (1 retry, reused step 2 meta-judge spec)
- All Judge Scores: 4.2, 4.5, 4.0, 4.3

### Example 3: Multi-file Refactoring with Escalation

**Input:**

```
/do-in-steps Rename 'userId' to 'accountId' across the codebase - this affects interfaces, implementations, and callers
```

**Phase 1 - Decomposition:**

| Step | Subtask | Depends On | Complexity | Type | Output |
|------|---------|------------|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Update interface definitions | - | High | Refactoring | Updated interfaces |
| 2 | Update implementations of those interfaces | Step 1 | Low | Refactoring | Updated implementations |
| 3 | Update callers and consumers | Step 2 | Low | Refactoring | Updated caller files |
| 4 | Update tests | Step 3 | Low | Testing | Updated test files |

| 2 | Update implementations | haiku | Mechanical rename |
| 3 | Update callers | haiku | Mechanical updates |
| 4 | Update tests | haiku | Mechanical test fixes |
| 5 | Update documentation | haiku | Simple text updates |

**Phase 3 - Execution with Escalation (each step has parallel meta-judge + implementation):**

```
Step 1: Update interfaces
  Parallel dispatch: Meta-judge + Implementation
  → Judge (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 1 meta-judge spec): PASS, 4.3/5.0

Step 2: Update implementations
  Parallel dispatch: Meta-judge + Implementation
  → Judge (Opus, sadd:judge, with step 2 meta-judge spec): PASS, 4.0/5.0

Step 3: Update callers (Problem Detected)
  Parallel dispatch: Meta-judge + Implementation
  Attempt 1: Judge FAIL, 2.5/5.0 (using step 3 meta-judge spec)
    → ISSUES: Missed 12 occurrences in legacy module
  Attempt 2: Judge FAIL, 2.8/5.0 (reusing same step 3 meta-judge spec)
    → ISSUES: Still missing 4 occurrences, found new deprecated API usage
  Attempt 3: Judge FAIL, 3.2/5.0 (reusing same step 3 meta-judge spec)
    → ISSUES: 2 occurrences in dynamically generated code
  Attempt 4: Judge FAIL, 3.3/5.0 (reusing same step 3 meta-judge spec)
    → ISSUES: Dynamic code generation still not fully addressed

  ESCALATION TO USER:
  "Step 3 failed after 4 attempts. Persistent issue: Dynamic code generation
   in LegacyAdapter.ts generates 'userId' at runtime.
   Options: 1) Provide guidance, 2) Modify requirements, 3) Skip, 4) Abort"

  User response: "Update LegacyAdapter to use string template with accountId"

  Attempt 5 (with user guidance, reusing same step 3 meta-judge spec): Judge PASS, 4.1/5.0

Step 4-5: Each with parallel meta-judge + implementation, complete without issues
```

Total Agents: 20 (5 meta-judges + 5 implementations + 5 retries + 5 judges)

## Best Practices

### Task Decomposition

- **Be explicit:** Each subtask should have a clear, verifiable outcome
- **Define verification points:** What should the judge check for each step?
- **Minimize steps:** Combine related work; don't over-decompose
- **Validate dependencies:** Ensure each step has what it needs from previous steps
- **Plan context:** Identify what context needs to pass between steps

### Model Selection

- **Match complexity:** Don't use Opus for simple transformations
- **Upgrade for risk:** First step and critical steps deserve stronger models
- **Consider chain effect:** Errors in early steps cascade; invest in quality early
- **When in doubt, use Opus:** Quality over cost for dependent steps

| Step Type | Implementation Model |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Critical/Breaking | Opus |
| Standard | Opus |
| Long and Simple | Sonnet |
| Simple and Short | Haiku |

### Context Passing Guidelines

| Scenario | What to Pass | What to Omit |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Interface defined in step 1 | Full interface definition | Implementation details |
| Implementation in step 2 | Key patterns, file locations | Internal logic |
| Integration in step 3 | Usage patterns, entry points | Step 2 internal details |
| Judge feedback for retry | ISSUES list, report path | Full report contents |

**Keep context focused:**

- Pass what the next step NEEDS to build on
- Omit internal details that don't affect subsequent steps
- Highlight patterns/conventions to maintain consistency
- Include judge IMPROVEMENTS as optional enhancements

### Meta-Judge + Judge Verification

- **Never skip meta-judge** - Tailored evaluation criteria produce better judgments than generic ones
- **One meta-judge per step** - Each step gets its own meta-judge dispatched in parallel with implementation
- **Reuse meta-judge spec across retries within a step** - On retry, reuse the same step's meta-judge specification; do NOT re-run meta-judge
- **New meta-judge for each new step** - Different steps have different requirements, so each gets a fresh meta-judge
- **Meta-judge FIRST in parallel dispatch** - Always the first tool call in the message
- **Parse only headers from judge** - Don't read full reports to avoid context pollution
- **Include CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT** - Both meta-judge and judge need the resolved plugin root path
- **Meta-judge YAML** - Pass only the meta-judge YAML to the judge, do not add any additional text or comments to it!
- **After self-critique:** Judge reviews work that already passed internal verification
- **Independent verification:** Judge is different agent than implementer
- **Structured output:** Always parse VERDICT/SCORE from reply, not full report
- **Max retries:** 3 attempts before escalating to user
- **Feedback loop:** Pass judge ISSUES to retry implementation agent
- **Return to judge verification with same step's meta-judge specification** on retry

### Quality Assurance

- **Two-layer verification:** Self-critique (internal) + Judge (external)
- **Self-critique first:** Implementation agents verify own work before submission
- **External judge second:** Independent judge catches blind spots self-critique misses
- **Iteration loop:** Retry with feedback until passing or max retries
- **Chain validation:** Judges check integration with previous steps
- **Escalation:** Don't proceed past failed steps - get user input
- **Final integration test:** After all steps, verify the complete change works together

## Context Format Reference

### Implementation Agent Output Format

```markdown
## Context for Next Steps

### Files Modified
- `src/dto/UserDTO.ts` (new file)
- `src/services/UserService.ts` (modified)

### Key Changes Summary
- Created UserDTO with fields: id (string), name (string), email (string), createdAt (Date)
- UserDTO includes static `fromUser(user: User): UserDTO` factory method
- Added `toDTO()` method to User class for convenience

### Decisions That Affect Later Steps
- Used class-based DTO (not interface) to enable transformation methods
- Opted for explicit mapping over automatic serialization for better control

### Warnings for Subsequent Steps
- UserDTO does NOT include password field - ensure no downstream code expects it
- The `createdAt` field is formatted as ISO string in JSON serialization

### Verification Points
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- UserDTO.fromUser() correctly maps all User properties
- Existing service tests still pass
```

### Judge Verdict Format (Structured Header)

```markdown
---
VERDICT: PASS
SCORE: 4.2/5.0
ISSUES:
  - None
IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Consider adding input validation to fromUser() method
  - Add JSDoc comments for better IDE support
---

## Detailed Evaluation
[Evidence and analysis following meta-judge specification rubrics...]
```

### Judge Verdict Format (FAIL Example)

```markdown
---
VERDICT: FAIL
SCORE: 2.8/5.0
ISSUES:
  - Missing User->UserDTO mapping logic in getUser() method
  - Return type annotation changed but actual return value still returns User object
  - No null handling for optional User fields
IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Add static fromUser() factory method to UserDTO
  - Implement toDTO() as instance method on User class
---
```

**Key Insight:** Complex tasks with dependencies benefit from sequential execution where each step operates in a fresh context while receiving only the relevant outputs from previous steps. **Per-step meta-judge evaluation specifications** ensure tailored evaluation criteria specific to each step's requirements, while running in parallel with implementation for speed. **External judge verification** catches blind spots that self-critique misses, while the **iteration loop** (reusing the same step's meta-judge spec) ensures quality before proceeding. This prevents both context pollution and error propagation.
