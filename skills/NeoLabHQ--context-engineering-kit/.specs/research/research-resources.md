# Research Resources

Resources that contain research that can be used to build plugins.

## List

[][YOLO Mode (You Only Look Once) automates your entire Phases workflow](https://docs.traycer.ai/tasks/yolo-mode) - Claude have `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to skip permissions check, so it can be used to run YOLO Mode without permissions check.
[][Agent0](https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.16043) - Unleashing Self-Evolving Agents from Zero Data via Tool-Integrated Reasoning
- <https://github.com/aiming-lab/Agent0>
[][Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030) - using `cat file | claude -p "query" --output-format` will run Query via SDK, then exit with json output. 
- Adding `--max-turns 3` will limit amount of turns to 3.
- `--json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{...}}' "query"` will validate the output against a JSON schema.
- `--model` flag to specify the model to use.
- `--permission-mode plan` will run agent in specified permissions mode <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/iam#permission-modes>

```bash
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",

  }
}'
```

[][First Principles Framework](https://github.com/m0n0x41d/quint-code)
[] Think about way to make reflection work as continues-learning agent. It can trigger on words like "You absolutily right", analyse it and save to CLAUDE.md file correction that user provided.
[][Hookify](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/hookify) - advanced hook configuration, that using python skills.

[] Add git workspaces usage for competitive model writing
[] Research how git notes can be used during code writing and review
[] Research how to add RAG style pipline with vector search to prepent relevant code to context window before code writing
