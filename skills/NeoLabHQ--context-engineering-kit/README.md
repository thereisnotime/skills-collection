# [Context Engineering Kit](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek)

A hand-crafted collection of advanced context engineering techniques and patterns with minimal token footprint, focused on improving agent result quality and predictability.

The marketplace is based on prompts our company's developers have used daily for a long time, supplemented by plugins from benchmarked papers and high-quality projects.

## Key Features

- **Simple to Use** - Easy to install and use without any dependencies. Contains automatically used skills and self-explanatory commands.
- **Token-Efficient** - Carefully crafted prompts and architecture, preferring command-oriented skills with sub-agents over general information skills when possible, to minimize populating context with unnecessary information.
- **Quality-Focused** - Each plugin is focused on meaningfully improving agent results in a specific area.
- **Granular** - Install only the plugins you need. Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills, without overlap or redundant skills.
- **Scientifically proven** - Plugins are based on proven techniques and patterns validated by reputable benchmarks and studies.
- **Open-Standards** - Skills are based on [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification. The [SDD](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd) plugin is based on the **Arc42** specification standard for software development documentation.

## News

Updates from key releases:

- **v3.1.0:** Improved [Spec-Driven Development plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd) generated code quality by embedding DDD/SOLID rules in the developer agent and adding a dedicated code-reviewer agent that applies functional and OOP best-practices rules together with Muda waste analysis to reduce code complexity and duplication.
- **v3.0.0:** Added support for AMP and Hermes agents. [Tech Stack plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/tech-stack) now automatically injects typescript best practices when agent reads or writes TypeScript files.
- **v2.2.0:** [Subagent-Driven Development plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sadd) now works as a distilled version of [SDD plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd) using meta-judge and judge sub-agents for specification generation on the fly and in parallel to implementation. [DDD plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/ddd) now includes Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID, Functional Programming, and other pattern examples as rules that are automatically added to the context during code writing.
- **v2.1.0:** [Spec-Driven Development plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd) agents include high-level code quality guidelines from [DDD plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/ddd).
- **v2.0.0:** [Spec-Driven Development plugin](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd) was rewritten from scratch. It is now able to produce working code in 99% of cases on real-life production projects!

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Marketplace and Plugins

#### Claude Code

Open Claude Code and add the Context Engineering Kit marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

This makes all plugins available for installation, but does not load any agents or skills into your context.

Install any plugin — for example, reflexion:

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Each installed plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills into Claude's context.

#### Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, OpenCode and others

Run the [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) command in your terminal:

```bash
npx skills add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```
You can pick which skills and agents to install.

<details>
<summary>Alternative installation methods</summary>

You can use [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) to install skills by running the following commands:

```bash
npx openskills install NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
npx openskills sync
```

</details>

### Step 2: Use Plugin

```bash
> claude "implement user authentication"
# Claude implements user authentication, then you can ask it to reflect on implementation

> /reflect
# It analyses results and suggests improvements
# If issues are obvious, it will fix them immediately
# If they are minor, it will suggest improvements that you can respond to
> fix the issues

# If you would like to prevent issues found during reflection from appearing again,
# ask Claude to extract resolution strategies and save the insights to project memory
> /memorize
```

Alternatively, you can use the `reflect` word in the initial prompt:

```bash
> claude "implement user authentication, then reflect"
# Claude implements user authentication,
# then hook automatically runs /reflect
```

In order to use this hook, you need to have `bun` installed. However, it is not required for the overall command.

## Documentation

You can find the complete Context Engineering Kit documentation [here](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek).

However, the main plugins we recommend starting with are [Subagent-Driven Development](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sadd) and [Spec-Driven Development](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd).

### Agent Reliability Engineering

The three plugins in this marketplace are designed to improve how accurately and consistently the agent follows provided instructions and to reduce hallucinations and bias toward incorrect solutions. They are not competitors but rather complementary to each other, because they allow you to balance reliability vs. token cost. Here is a high-level comparison of different agent usage approaches and the probability of receiving results that are fully accurate and include zero hallucinations, based on task complexity:

### [Spec-Driven Development](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/sdd)

Comprehensive specification-driven development workflow plugin that transforms prompts into production-ready implementations through structured planning, architecture design, and quality-gated execution.

This plugin is designed to consistently produce working code. It was tested on real-life production projects by our team, and in 100% of cases, it generated working code aligned with the initial prompt. If you find a use case it cannot handle, please report it as an issue.

#### Key Features

- **Development as compilation** — The plugin works like a "compilation" or "nightly build" for your development process: `task specs → run /implement-task → working code`. After writing your prompt, you can launch the plugin and expect a working result when you come back. The time it takes depends on task complexity — simple tasks may finish in 30 minutes, while complex ones can take a few days.
- **Benchmark-level quality in real life** — Model benchmarks improve with each release, yet real-world results usually stay the same. That's because benchmarks reflect the best possible output a model can achieve, whereas in practice LLMs tend to drift toward sub-optimal solutions that can be wrong or non-functional. This plugin uses a variety of patterns to keep the model working at its peak performance.
- **Customizable** — Balance result quality and process speed by adjusting command parameters. Learn more in the [Customization](./customization.md) section.
- **Time-efficient for developers** — The overall process is designed to minimize developer time and reduce the number of interactions, while still producing results better than what a model can generate from scratch. However, overall quality is highly proportional to the time you invest in iterating and refining the specification.
- **Industry-standard** — The plugin's specification template is based on the arc42 standard, adjusted for LLM capabilities. Arc42 is a widely adopted, high-quality standard for software development documentation used by many companies and organizations.
- **Works best in complex or large codebases** — While most other frameworks work best for new projects and greenfield development, this plugin is designed to perform better the more existing code and well-structured architecture you have. At each planning phase, it includes a **codebase impact analysis** step that evaluates which files may be affected and which patterns to follow to achieve the desired result.
- **Simple** — This plugin avoids unnecessary complexity and mainly uses just 3 commands, offloading process complexity to the model via multi-agent orchestration. `/implement-task` is a single command that produces working code from a task specification. To create that specification, you run `/sdd:add-task` and `/plan-task`, which analyze your prompt and iteratively refine the specification until it meets the required quality.

#### Quick Start

```bash
/plugin install sdd@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
# create .specs/tasks/draft/design-auth-middleware.feature.md file with initial prompt
/add-task "Design and implement authentication middleware with JWT support"

# write detailed specification for the task
/plan-task
# will move task to .specs/tasks/todo/ folder
```

Restart the Claude Code session to clear context and start fresh. Then run the following command:

```bash
# implement the task
/implement-task @.specs/tasks/todo/design-auth-middleware.feature.md
# produces working implementation and moves the task to .specs/tasks/done/ folder
```

#### Patterns

Key patterns implemented in this plugin:

- **Structured reasoning templates** — includes Zero-shot and Few-shot Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Problem Decomposition, and Self-Critique. Each is tailored to a specific agent and task, enabling sufficiently detailed decomposition so that isolated sub-agents can implement each step independently.
- **Multi-agent orchestration for context management** — Context isolation of independent agents prevents the context rot problem, essentially keeping LLMs at optimal performance at each step of the process. The main agent acts as an orchestrator that launches sub-agents and controls their work.
- **Quality gates based on LLM-as-Judge** — Evaluate the quality of each planning and implementation step using evidence-based scoring and predefined verification rubrics. This fully eliminates cases where an agent produces non-working or incorrect solutions.
- **Continuous learning** — Builds skills that the agent needs to implement a specific task, which it would otherwise not be able to perform from scratch.
- **Spec-driven development pattern** — Based on the arc42 specification standard, adjusted for LLM capabilities, to eliminate parts of the specification that add no value to implementation quality or that could degrade it.
- **MAKER** — An agent reliability pattern introduced in [Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030). It removes agent mistakes caused by accumulated context and hallucinations by utilizing clean-state agent launches, filesystem-based memory storage, and multi-agent voting during critical decision-making.

#### Vibe Coding vs. Specification-Driven Development

This plugin is not a "vibe coding" solution, but out of the box, it works like one. By default, it is designed to work from a single prompt through to the end of the task, making reasonable assumptions and evidence-based decisions instead of constantly asking for clarification. This is because developer time is more valuable than model time. As a result, the plugin is designed to allow the developer to decide how much time the task is worth. The plugin will always produce working results, but quality will be sub-optimal if no human feedback is provided.

To improve quality, after generating a specification you can correct it or leave comments using `//`, then run the `/plan` command again with the `--refine` flag. You can also verify each planning and implementation phase by adding the `--human-in-the-loop` flag. According to most known research, human feedback is the most effective way to improve results.

Our tests showed that even when the initially generated specification was incorrect due to lack of information or task complexity, the agent was still able to self-correct until it reached a working solution. However, it usually takes much longer and results in the agent spending time on wrong paths and stopping more frequently. To avoid this, we strongly advise decomposing tasks into smaller separate tasks with dependencies and reviewing the specification for each one independently. You can add dependencies between tasks as arguments to the `/add-task` command, and the agent will link them together by adding a `depends_on` section to the task file frontmatter.

Even if you don't want to spend much time on this process, you can still use the plugin for complex tasks without decomposition or human verification — but you will likely need tools like ralph-loop to keep the agent running for longer.

### [FPF - First Principles Framework](https://neolab.gitbook.io/cek/plugins/fpf)

A structured reasoning plugin that implements the **[First Principles Framework (FPF)](https://github.com/ailev/FPF)** by Anatoly Levenchuk — a methodology for rigorous, auditable reasoning. The killer feature is turning the black box of AI reasoning into a transparent, evidence-backed audit trail. The plugin makes AI decision-making transparent and auditable. Instead of jumping to solutions, FPF enforces generating competing hypotheses, checking them logically, testing against evidence, then letting developers choose.

Key principles:

- **Transparent reasoning** - Full audit trail from hypothesis to decision
- **Hypothesis-driven** - Generate 3-5 competing alternatives before evaluating
- **Evidence-based** - Computed trust scores, not estimates
- **Human-in-the-loop** - AI generates options; humans decide (Transformer Mandate)

The core cycle follows three modes of inference:

1. **Abduction** — Generate competing hypotheses (don't anchor on the first idea).
2. **Deduction** — Verify logic and constraints (does the idea make sense?).
3. **Induction** — Gather evidence through tests or research (does the idea work in reality?).

Then, audit for bias, decide, and document the rationale in a durable record.

> **Warning:** This plugin loads the core FPF specification into context, which is large (~600k tokens). As a result, it is loaded into a subagent with the Sonnet[1m] model. However, such an agent can consume your token limit quickly.

**How to install**

```bash
/plugin install fpf@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

#### Usage workflow

```bash
# Execute complete FPF cycle from hypothesis to decision
/propose-hypotheses What caching strategy should we use?

# The workflow will:
# 1. Initialize context and .fpf/ directory
# 2. Generate competing hypotheses
# 3. Allow you to add your own alternatives
# 4. Verify each against project constraints (parallel)
# 5. Validate with evidence (parallel)
# 6. Compute trust scores (parallel)
# 7. Present comparison for your decision
```
