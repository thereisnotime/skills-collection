# Agent Reference

Complete reference for all agents in AgentSys.

<!-- GEN:START:agents-counts -->
**TL;DR:** 10 agents across 0 plugins (1 have agents). opus for reasoning, sonnet for patterns, haiku for execution. Each agent does one thing well. <!-- AGENT_COUNT_TOTAL: 10 -->
<!-- GEN:END:agents-counts -->

---

## Quick Navigation

<!-- GEN:START:agents-nav -->
| Plugin | Agents | Jump to |
|--------|--------|---------|
<!-- GEN:END:agents-nav -->

**Design principle:** Each agent has a single responsibility. Complex work is decomposed into specialized agents that do one thing extremely well, then orchestrated together.

**Related docs:**
- [/next-task Workflow](../workflows/NEXT-TASK.md) - How agents work together

---

## Overview

AgentSys uses 47 specialized agents across 19 plugins (17 have agents - ship and gate-and-ship use commands only). Each agent is optimized for a specific task and assigned a model based on complexity:

| Model | Use Case | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| opus | Complex reasoning, quality-critical work | High |
| sonnet | Moderate reasoning, pattern matching | Medium |
| haiku | Mechanical execution, no judgment | Low |

**Agent types:**
- **File-based agents** (37) - Defined in `plugins/*/agents/*.md` with frontmatter <!-- AGENT_COUNT_FILE_BASED: 37 -->
- **Role-based agents** (10) - Defined inline via Task tool with specialized prompts <!-- AGENT_COUNT_ROLE_BASED: 10 -->

**What it does:**
1. Loads claimed tasks from `tasks.json` (excludes them)
2. Fetches from GitHub Issues, GitHub Projects (v2 boards), GitLab, local files, or custom CLI
3. Excludes issues that already have an open PR (GitHub source only)
4. Applies priority scoring (labels, blockers, age, reactions)
5. Presents top 5 via AskUserQuestion checkboxes
6. Posts "Workflow Started" comment to GitHub issue

**Tools available:**
- Bash (gh, glab, git)
- Grep, Read
- AskUserQuestion

---

### worktree-manager

**Purpose:** Create git worktrees for isolated development.

**What it does:**
1. Creates `../worktrees/{task-slug}/` directory
2. Creates `feature/{task-slug}` branch
3. Claims task in `tasks.json`
4. Creates `flow.json` in worktree

**Tools available:**

### exploration-agent

**Model:** opus

4. Analyzes existing patterns
5. Outputs exploration report

**Tools available:**
- Read, Glob, Grep
- Bash (git only)
- LSP
- Task (for sub-exploration)

**Why opus:** Exploration quality directly impacts planning quality. Poor exploration = poor plan = poor implementation. The compound effect justifies the cost.

---

### planning-agent

**Model:** opus
**Purpose:** Design step-by-step implementation plans.

**What it does:**
1. Synthesizes exploration findings
2. Creates implementation steps
3. Identifies risks and critical paths

```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "action": "modify", "file": "src/auth.ts", "description": "..." }
  ],
  "risks": ["..."],
  "complexity": "medium"
}
```

**Why opus:** Planning is the leverage point. A good plan makes implementation straightforward. A bad plan causes rework cycles.

---

### implementation-agent

**Model:** opus
**Purpose:** Execute approved plans with production-quality code.

**What it does:**
1. Executes plan step-by-step

## Model Selection Rationale

| Agent Type | Model | Reasoning |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Analysis/reasoning | opus | Quality compounds - errors propagate |
| Pattern matching | sonnet | Good at structured tasks, fast |
| Mechanical execution | haiku | No judgment needed, cheapest |

**Key insight:** For enhancers and analyzers, quality loss is exponential. Each imperfection in analysis creates downstream problems.

---

## Tool Restrictions

Agents have restricted tool access for safety:

| Agent | Restricted From | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| implementation-agent | PR creation, git push | Workflow enforces order |
| prepare-delivery:delivery-validator | PR creation, git push | Must pass validation first |
| worktree-manager | Most tools | Only needs git |
| simple-fixer | Most tools | Only needs edit |
