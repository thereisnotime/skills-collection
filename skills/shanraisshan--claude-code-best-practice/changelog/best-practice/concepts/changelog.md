| 2 | HIGH | Stale URL/Anchor (NEW) | Git Worktrees row primary URL points to `/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees` — but a dedicated `/en/worktrees` page now exists (covers `--worktree`/`-w` flag, `.worktreeinclude`, WorktreeCreate/Remove hooks, non-git VCS) AND the legacy common-workflows anchor has been renamed to `#run-parallel-sessions-with-worktrees` (word "git" dropped). Both verified live | ✅ COMPLETE (URL switched to `/en/worktrees` dedicated page; Location column expanded with `--worktree`/`-w`, `.worktreeinclude`, `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` hooks per user authorization) |
| 3 | HIGH | Missing Concept (NEW) | v2.1.139 introduced **Agent View** (`claude agents`, `--bg`, `/bg`) — research preview "one screen for many background sessions" with peek/attach/dispatch. Dedicated docs page `/en/agent-view` confirmed live | ✅ COMPLETE (Hot row added after Agent Teams with `![beta]` badge per `<Note>` "research preview" banner; description notes supervisor hosting and reboot persistence) |
| 4 | HIGH | Missing Concept (NEW) | v2.1.139 introduced **/goal** command — keep Claude working across turns until a model-evaluated condition holds (session-scoped Stop hook wrapper). Dedicated docs page `/en/goal` confirmed live | ✅ COMPLETE (Hot row added after Tasks; description compares to `/loop` and auto mode per docs framing) |
| 5 | MED | Missing Concept (NEW) | **Deep Links** (`claude-cli://open?repo=…&q=…`) introduced v2.1.91 — custom URL scheme for runbooks/alerts/dashboards. Dedicated docs page `/en/deep-links` confirmed live; never surfaced in CONCEPTS across any prior run | ✅ COMPLETE (Hot row added after Remote Control — both are session-launching surfaces; description mentions runbooks/alerts/dashboards use cases and OS-level handler registration) |
| 6 | LOW | Missing Concept (NEW) | v2.1.139 added `/scroll-speed` command — tunes mouse wheel scroll speed with live preview | ✋ ON HOLD (deferred — minor UX command, no dedicated docs page; would only fit as a CLI Startup Flags sub-link if at all) |
| 7 | HIGH | Stale URL (recurring) | Commands URL `/slash-commands` not in official sitemap — redirects to `/skills`; canonical commands reference is `/en/commands` | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10; URL still resolves via redirect; user has chosen to keep as-is across 22+ runs) |
| 8 | MED | Missing Concept (recurring) | Dedicated agent re-flagged Output Styles, Permissions, Sandboxing, Headless Mode, Desktop App, IDE Integration, .claude Directory, Tools Reference as missing standalone rows | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10/2026-03-17/2026-04-08/2026-04-09/2026-05-01; user considers all platform surfaces or covered as Settings sub-links — not standalone concepts) |

| 11 | LOW | Verification | Local badge file paths validated — `best-practice/`, `implementation/`, `reports/`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md` targets exist on filesystem | ✅ COMPLETE (no missing local files) |
| 12 | LOW | Verification | Beta Badge Currency (rule #7) — fetched `/en/agent-view` and confirmed `<Note>` banner: "Agent view is a research preview and requires Claude Code v2.1.139 or later" — if added, a beta badge would be accurate | ✅ COMPLETE (badge recommendation noted for action item #3) |
| 13 | LOW | Verification | Memory anchor `#organize-rules-with-clauderules` — stable since v2.1.113 | ✅ COMPLETE (stable) |

| # | Priority | Type | Action | Status |
|---|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | Wrong Location (NEW) | Checkpointing row (line 36) Location reads `automatic (git-based)` — factually wrong. Live `/en/checkpointing` fetch confirms checkpoints track "all changes made by its file editing tools", explicitly "do not track files modified by bash commands", and are "Not a replacement for version control" — *"Think of checkpoints as 'local undo' and Git as 'permanent history'."* The 2026-04-24 run only checked the (empty) Description column, never the Location, so this slipped through every prior run. Recommend `automatic (file-edit tracking)` | ✅ COMPLETE (user authorized; line 36 Location updated `automatic (git-based)` → `automatic (file-edit tracking)`) |
| 2 | MED | Missing Concept (NEW) | **Sessions** has a dedicated `/en/sessions` page (resume, `/rename`, fork/branch via `--fork-session`) never surfaced in CONCEPTS across any prior run; concepts-agent flagged at 0.6 confidence as possibly a runtime surface rather than an authoring concept | ❌ INVALID (user chose to skip — consistent with the standing "platform/runtime surface, not configuration concept" rejection pattern) |
| 3 | HIGH | Stale URL (recurring) | Commands URL `/slash-commands` not in official sitemap — redirects to `/skills`; canonical commands reference is `/en/commands` | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10; URL still resolves via redirect; user has chosen to keep as-is across 23+ runs) |
| 4 | MED | Missing Concept (recurring) | Dedicated + claude-code-guide agents re-flagged IDE Integration, Desktop App, Output Styles, Permissions, Sandboxing, Headless Mode, .claude Directory, Tools Reference as missing standalone rows | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10/2026-03-17/2026-04-08/2026-05-01/2026-05-12; user considers all platform surfaces or covered as Settings/Memory sub-links — not standalone concepts) |
| 5 | LOW | Verification | Fast Mode URL `/en/fast-mode` fetched live — page valid ("Speed up responses with fast mode"), research preview, `/fast` toggle + `"fastMode": true` setting, Opus 4.7 default since v2.1.142; resolves concepts-agent's 0.5-confidence doubt — README Fast Mode row (line 52) is fully accurate | ✅ COMPLETE (row confirmed accurate, no change needed) |
| 6 | LOW | Verification | Latest version confirmed v2.1.145 via raw CHANGELOG.md (blob URL returns no body — used raw.githubusercontent.com per the documented workaround); v2.1.145 adds JSON session listing + OTEL agent identity — nothing CONCEPTS-worthy | ✅ COMPLETE (version verified; badge bumped v2.1.144 → v2.1.145 in Phase 2.6) |
| 7 | LOW | Verification | External CONCEPTS docs URLs spot-validated (`/en/checkpointing`, `/en/fast-mode`, CHANGELOG raw) + remainder stable since v2.1.139 run — only the recurring `/slash-commands` redirect flagged | ✅ COMPLETE (no NEW broken URLs) |

| 11 | LOW | Verification | claude-code-guide cross-check — independent 80-concept sweep corroborated coverage; surfaced Auto Dream + MCP Tool Search as possible Memory/MCP sub-links and re-surfaced platform surfaces (RECURRING INVALID). Its version numbers were unreliable (e.g. "MCP introduced Dec 2024", fuzzy v-numbers) — deferred to dedicated agent + live fetches for all dates; no contradictions affecting CONCEPTS | ✅ COMPLETE (agents aligned; guide's fuzzy versioning noted, not used) |

| 1 | HIGH | Wrong Location (NEW) | Simplify & Batch row (line 70) Location `/simplify`, `/batch` and the row name are stale — `/simplify` was **renamed to `/code-review`** in v2.1.147. Triple-confirmed: CHANGELOG *"Renamed `/simplify` to `/code-review`… pass `--comment` to post findings as inline GitHub PR comments"*; `/en/skills` bundled-skills list now reads `/code-review, /batch, /debug, /loop, /claude-api` (no `/simplify`); `/en/code-review` docs note *"The command was named `/simplify` before v2.1.147."* Naming collision with existing cloud Code Review row (line 59) — fix approach needs user choice | ✅ COMPLETE (user chose "Bundled Skills" rename; row 70 renamed `Simplify & Batch` → `Bundled Skills`, Location `/simplify`, `/batch` → `/code-review`, `/batch`; avoids collision since row is really the bundled-skills concept) |
| 2 | LOW | Optional Inline Link (NEW) | Code Review row (line 59, cloud GitHub App) could add inline link to the local `/code-review` command (`/en/commands`) — docs now formally cross-reference the local "twin" of the cloud feature | ✅ COMPLETE (user approved; `[Local /code-review](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands)` inline link appended to Code Review row line 59) |
| 3 | HIGH | Stale URL (recurring) | Commands URL `/slash-commands` not in official sitemap — redirects to `/skills`; canonical commands reference is `/en/commands` | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10; URL still resolves via redirect; user has chosen to keep as-is across 24+ runs) |

|---|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | Missing Concept (NEW) | Add **Dynamic Workflows** row to Hot table — v2.1.154 introduced script-based orchestration of tens-to-hundreds of subagents (`/workflows`, `workflow` keyword, `/effort ultracode`, `.claude/workflows/`, bundled `/deep-research`). Dedicated `/en/workflows` docs page confirmed live; both agents independently flagged it as the top gap. Distinct from existing "Workflows" row (line 30, `/en/common-workflows` = Research→Plan→Execute patterns) — name it **Dynamic Workflows** to avoid collision | ✅ COMPLETE (user approved; row inserted at line 64 between Deep Links and Agent Teams to cluster the multi-agent orchestration surfaces — Dynamic Workflows → Agent Teams → Agent View — with `![beta]` badge and `[Deep Research]` link; table re-verified 3-column consistent) |
| 2 | MED | Beta Badge Currency (rule #7) | Concepts-agent doubted Auto Mode `![beta]` badge (0.5) citing "no longer requires opt-in" (v2.1.152) | ❌ INVALID (live `/en/permission-modes` `<Warning>` confirms *"Auto mode is a research preview"* — badge accurate, no demotion; agent's body-text read contradicted by banner, same pattern as 2026-04-26) |
| 3 | HIGH | Stale URL (recurring) | Commands URL `/slash-commands` not in official sitemap — redirects to `/skills`; canonical commands reference is `/en/commands` | ❌ INVALID (RECURRING from 2026-03-10; URL still resolves via redirect; user has chosen to keep as-is across 25+ runs) |

| 5 | LOW | Model Freshness (out of scope) | Concepts-agent flagged TIPS section references "Opus 4.7" while Opus 4.8 is now default (v2.1.154) | ✋ ON HOLD (TIPS-section content, outside the CONCEPTS-table scope of this workflow; deferred to user — not a CONCEPTS-table action item) |
| 6 | LOW | Verification | Latest version confirmed v2.1.158 via raw CHANGELOG.md (blob URL returns no body — used raw.githubusercontent.com per documented workaround); v2.1.155–158 add thinking-block fix (2.1.156), `.claude/skills` plugin auto-load (2.1.157), auto mode on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry (2.1.158) — nothing CONCEPTS-worthy beyond #1 | ✅ COMPLETE (version verified; badge bumped v2.1.150 → v2.1.158 in Phase 2.6) |
| 7 | LOW | Verification | `/en/workflows` fetched live — `<Note>` "Dynamic workflows are in research preview… require Claude Code v2.1.154 or later"; `#run-a-bundled-workflow` anchor confirmed; Location claims (`/workflows`, `workflow` keyword, `/effort ultracode`, `.claude/workflows/`) all verified against page body | ✅ COMPLETE (NEW URL returns expected canonical page; rules #1/#2/#8 satisfied for the new row) |

| 9 | LOW | Verification | Local badge/link target files validated via filesystem check — `best-practice/`, `implementation/`, `reports/` targets exist; `implementation/claude-tasks-implementation.md` is **absent**, so concepts-agent's "add Tasks Implemented badge" suggestion is not actionable (no file to link) | ✅ COMPLETE (no missing local files among linked targets; Tasks-badge suggestion INVALID for lack of target) |
| 10 | LOW | Verification | Command rename scan (rule #9) — changelog top 10 shows no NEW renames affecting Location-column command names; `/code-review`,`/batch` in Bundled Skills row still accurate; `/deep-research` is a new bundled workflow command surfaced under the proposed Dynamic Workflows row | ✅ COMPLETE (no rename drift; `/reload-skills` v2.1.152 is a new command, not a rename) |
| 11 | LOW | Verification | claude-code-guide cross-check — independent 99-concept sweep corroborated Dynamic Workflows (v2.1.154), Opus 4.8, Ultracode; re-surfaced platform surfaces (RECURRING INVALID); flagged a docs/changelog lag — changelog 2.1.158 says auto mode reached Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry while `/en/permission-modes` still reads "Anthropic API only" (not CONCEPTS-actionable; Auto Mode row makes no provider claim) | ✅ COMPLETE (agents aligned on the NEW finding; lag noted, no action) |

| # | Priority | Type | Action | Status |
|---|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | Changed Location (NEW) | Ultrareview row Location column: `/ultrareview` → `/code-review ultra` per official docs `/en/ultrareview` — page explicitly states "The command is now invoked as `/code-review ultra`, and `/ultrareview` remains as an alias"; CLI subcommand `claude ultrareview` unchanged. Rule #8 (Location Column Factual Accuracy) violation: presenting alias as primary invocation | ✅ COMPLETE (Location updated from `/ultrareview` to `/code-review ultra`; `claude ultrareview [target]` retained for CLI) |
