# Claude Code Sub-Agents - Deep Documentation

This document provides comprehensive guidance for creating, configuring, and using sub-agents in Claude Code. Use this as reference when working with the sub-agent system.

## Overview

Claude Code's sub-agent system allows you to create specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks with dedicated context, tools, and expertise. Sub-agents operate independently with their own context windows, making them ideal for focused, repeatable workflows.

## Sub-Agent Fundamentals

### What Are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that:

- **Operate independently** with separate context windows from the main conversation
- **Have targeted expertise** through custom system prompts
- **Access specific tools** with configurable permissions
- **Preserve context** in the main conversation while handling complex subtasks
- **Enable reusability** across projects and team members

### Core Benefits

**Context Preservation:**

- Main conversation context remains clean and focused
- Sub-agent handles detailed analysis without cluttering main thread
- Results summarized back to main conversation

**Specialized Expertise:**

- Custom system prompts define specific domain knowledge
- Focused behavior patterns for particular task types
- Consistent approach to similar problems

**Reusability:**

- Define once, use across multiple conversations
- Share configurations across team members
- Version control for team consistency

**Flexible Permissions:**

- Restrict tool access to only what's needed
- Enhance security with minimal privilege principle
- Prevent unintended operations

## Sub-Agent File Structure

### File Locations

- **Project-specific**: `.claude/subagents/` (version controlled, team shared)
- **Personal**: `~/.claude/subagents/` (user-specific, cross-project)

### Basic File Structure

```markdown
---
# Frontmatter configuration (YAML)
description: Brief agent description
allowed-tools: Tool(pattern:constraints)
model: Specific AI model (optional)
---

# System Prompt

Your detailed system prompt that defines the agent's expertise,
behavior, and task approach.
```

## Frontmatter Configuration

### Core Configuration Fields

#### `description`

Brief explanation of agent purpose (shown in agent selection):

```yaml
description: Expert code quality and security reviewer
```

#### `allowed-tools`

Specifies which tools the agent can use, with optional constraints:

```yaml
# Single tool with any arguments
allowed-tools: Read

# Multiple tools
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

# Tool with specific command constraints
allowed-tools: Bash(git *:*, npm test:*)

# Tool with multiple patterns
allowed-tools: Bash(git diff:*, git log:*), Read(src/**)

# Complex constraints
allowed-tools: Read, Edit(src/**/*), Bash(npm test:*, npm run lint:*)
```

**Tool Constraint Patterns:**

- `*` - wildcard matching
- `tool:*` - any arguments for specific command
- `command:constraint` - specific command with constraint
- `path/**/*` - recursive path patterns
- Multiple patterns separated by commas

#### `model`

Forces specific AI model for this agent:

```yaml
model: sonnet # or claude-3-haiku, opus, etc.
```

## System Prompts

### Crafting Effective System Prompts

System prompts define the agent's expertise, behavior, and approach. They should:

1. **Define expertise domain clearly**
2. **Specify task approach and methodology**
3. **Include quality criteria and standards**
4. **Provide output format expectations**
5. **Set boundaries and constraints**

### System Prompt Structure

**Expert Identity:**

```markdown

Your role is to [PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY].
```

**Task Methodology:**

```markdown
When analyzing [TASK TYPE], follow this approach:

1. [STEP 1]
2. [STEP 2]
3. [STEP 3]
```

**Quality Standards:**

```markdown
Focus on:

- [CRITERION 1]
- [CRITERION 2]
- [CRITERION 3]

Prioritize findings by severity: Critical > High > Medium > Low
```

**Output Format:**

```markdown
Provide results in this format:

## [SECTION 1]

## Agent Invocation Patterns

### Automatic Delegation

Claude Code automatically delegates to sub-agents based on task description:

```markdown
User: "Please review my recent code changes for security issues"
Claude: [Automatically invokes code-reviewer sub-agent]
```

### Explicit Invocation

Explicitly mention the agent name:

```markdown
User: "Use the debugger agent to investigate this error"
Claude: [Invokes debugger sub-agent]
```

### Tool-Based Invocation

Use the Task tool programmatically:

```typescript
// In custom commands or workflows
Task({
  subagent_type: 'code-reviewer',
  description: 'Review security changes',
  prompt: 'Analyze the authentication module changes for security vulnerabilities',
});
```

## Common Agent Patterns

## Best Practices

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear, focused purpose
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define what the agent should and shouldn't do
3. **Minimal Tools**: Only grant access to tools the agent actually needs
4. **Detailed Prompts**: Provide comprehensive system prompts for consistency
5. **Testable**: Agents should produce verifiable, consistent results

### Security Considerations

**Tool Restrictions:**

```yaml
# Too permissive - avoid
allowed-tools: Bash, Edit, Write

# Better - specific constraints
allowed-tools: Bash(npm test:*, git diff:*), Edit(src/**)

# Best - minimal necessary permissions
allowed-tools: Read(src/**/*.ts), Bash(npm test:*)
```

**File Access Patterns:**

```yaml
# Restrict operations to specific paths
allowed-tools: Read(src/**/*), Write(docs/**/*.md), Edit(src/**/*.ts)
```

**Command Restrictions:**

```yaml
# Allow only safe, specific commands
allowed-tools: Bash(git diff:*, git log:*, npm test:*)
```

### Quality Guidelines

**System Prompt Quality:**

- Be explicit about methodology and approach
- Define output format and structure expectations
- Include quality criteria and standards
- Set clear boundaries on what agent should/shouldn't do
- Provide examples of expected behavior

**Tool Configuration:**

- Start with minimal tool access
- Add tools only as needed
- Use specific constraints over wildcards
- Document why each tool is required

**Testing and Validation:**

- Test agents with various input scenarios
- Verify agents stay within defined boundaries
- Ensure output format consistency
- Validate tool usage matches expectations

## Advanced Patterns
