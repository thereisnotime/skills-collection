# Skill Authoring Guide

This guide explains how to write a new skill for Claude Scientific Writer and get it registered so it ships with the plugin, the CLI, and the Python API. For general contribution workflow (tests, lint, PRs), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where Skills Live

The `skills/` directory at the repository root is the **canonical source of truth**. Two mirrors are generated from it and must never be edited directly:

- `.claude/skills/` (used by the CLI and local development)
- `scientific_writer/.claude/skills/` (bundled with the Python package)

After any change under `skills/`, regenerate the mirrors:

```bash
python scripts/sync_skills.py
```

CI verifies the mirrors with `python scripts/sync_skills.py --check`.

## Directory Layout

Each skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` file and optional supporting subdirectories:

```
skills/
└── my-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required: frontmatter + instructions
    ├── references/       # Optional: in-depth reference documents (.md)
    ├── scripts/          # Optional: helper scripts invoked via Bash
    └── assets/           # Optional: templates, examples, style files
```

Keep `SKILL.md` focused on *how the agent should act*; move long background material into `references/` and point to it from `SKILL.md` so the agent loads it only when needed.

## SKILL.md Frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it. This skill should be used when the user asks for X, Y, or Z.
allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash
license: MIT license
metadata:
    skill-author: K-Dense Inc.
---
```

Field reference:

| Field | Required | Format | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphen-separated | Must match the directory name |
| `description` | Yes | 1-3 sentences | States what the skill does **and when it should trigger**. This is what the agent reads to decide whether to load the skill, so include concrete trigger phrases ("Use when...", "This skill should be used when...") |
| `allowed-tools` | Yes | Space-separated string, e.g. `Read Write Edit Bash` | Not a YAML list. Restricts which tools the agent may call while the skill is active |
| `license` | Yes | e.g. `MIT license` | License for the skill content |
| `metadata.skill-author` | Yes | `K-Dense Inc.` | Author attribution for skills contributed to this repository |
| `compatibility` | No | Free text | Runtime requirements, e.g. required CLIs or environment variables |

A common mistake is writing `allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash]` (list style); the convention in this repository is the space-separated string `allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash`.

## Writing the Skill Body

Below the frontmatter, write the instructions the agent follows when the skill is active. Guidelines:

- **Start with an Overview** describing the skill's purpose in a short paragraph.
- **Give a concrete workflow**: numbered steps the agent should follow, including exact commands for any scripts in `scripts/`.
- **Show usage examples**: example user prompts and the expected behavior.
- **State environment requirements explicitly** (e.g., "requires `PARALLEL_API_KEY`") and describe fallback behavior when a dependency is missing.
- **Reference supporting files by relative path** (e.g., `references/citation_styles.md`) so the agent can read them on demand.

## Registering the Skill

New skills must be registered in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, which defines the `claude-scientific-writer` plugin. Add the skill directory to the `skills` array of the plugin entry:

```json
"skills": [
  "./skills/citation-management",
  "./skills/my-skill-name",
  ...
]
```

A skill that exists under `skills/` but is not listed in `marketplace.json` will not be available to plugin users.

## Full Workflow Checklist

1. Create `skills/my-skill-name/` with a `SKILL.md` (and `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` as needed).
2. Fill in the frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools` (space-separated), `license`, `metadata.skill-author`.
3. Register the directory in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
4. Run `python scripts/sync_skills.py` to regenerate the mirrors, and commit the regenerated files.
5. Verify with `python scripts/sync_skills.py --check`.
6. Test locally: reinstall the plugin from a test marketplace (see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#plugin-development)) and confirm the skill appears when you ask "What skills are available?".
7. Add a section describing the skill to [docs/SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) if it is user-facing.

## Minimum Quality Bar

Before opening a pull request, a new skill should meet all of the following:

- **Triggers correctly**: the `description` is specific enough that the agent activates the skill for its intended requests and not for unrelated ones.
- **Self-contained**: all scripts run with the project's declared dependencies; any extra requirements are documented in the frontmatter (`compatibility`) and the skill body.
- **Working examples**: every command shown in `SKILL.md` has been executed successfully from a clean checkout.
- **No secrets or personal paths**: no API keys, usernames, or absolute paths from your machine.
- **Consistent voice**: instructions are written as directives to the agent, matching the style of existing skills.
- **Mirrors in sync**: `python scripts/sync_skills.py --check` passes.
