# Development and Architecture

This document is for contributors and maintainers. It summarizes the package architecture, design decisions, and development workflow for Scientific Writer (v2.15+). For day-to-day contribution workflow (tests, lint, PR guidelines), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Architecture Overview

### Package Structure

```
scientific_writer/
├── __init__.py          # Public API exports, version
├── api.py               # Async generate_paper() function
├── cli.py               # CLI entrypoint (cli_main)
├── core.py              # Core utilities (API keys, instructions, data processing)
├── models.py            # Data models (ProgressUpdate, PaperResult, etc.)
└── utils.py             # Helper functions (paper detection, file scanning)
```

### Plugin Structure

```
claude-scientific-writer/
├── .claude-plugin/          # Plugin marketplace metadata
│   └── marketplace.json     # Defines the claude-scientific-writer plugin and its skills
├── commands/                # Plugin commands
│   └── scientific-writer-init.md
├── skills/                  # All 25 skills (canonical source of truth)
│   ├── citation-management/
│   ├── clinical-reports/
│   ├── research-lookup/
│   └── ... (22 more)
├── templates/               # CLAUDE.md template
│   └── CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md
└── scientific_writer/       # Python package
```

There is no `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; the repository itself acts as a plugin marketplace via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, which registers the `claude-scientific-writer` plugin and lists all 25 skill directories.

The 25 skills are: citation-management, clinical-decision-support, clinical-reports, document-skills, generate-image, hypothesis-generation, infographics, latex-posters, literature-review, market-research-reports, markitdown, paper-2-web, parallel-web, peer-review, poster-presentation, pptx-posters, research-grants, research-lookup, scholar-evaluation, scientific-critical-thinking, scientific-schematics, scientific-slides, scientific-writing, treatment-plans, and venue-templates.

### Key Components

- `api.generate_paper`: Async generator streaming progress and yielding a comprehensive result
- `cli.cli_main`: CLI interface; 100% backward-compatible behavior
- `core`: Shared logic for API key retrieval, instruction loading, output management, data handling
- `models`: Typed dataclasses for API responses
- `utils`: File scanning, paper detection, and helpers
- **Plugin System**: Commands, skills, and templates for Claude Code integration

## Data Models

- `ProgressUpdate`: real-time progress updates (stage, message, timestamp, details)
- `PaperResult`: final result with status, files, metadata, citations, token_usage, and errors
- `PaperMetadata`: title, created_at, topic, word_count
- `PaperFiles`: all relevant paths (final, drafts, references, figures, data, logs)
- `TokenUsage`: token consumption statistics (input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens, cache stats)

All models are fully typed and serializable to dictionaries.

## API Design

- Async generator pattern for real-time updates and a final, comprehensive result
- Stateless operation per invocation
- Robust error handling with `success | partial | failed` status
- Automatic paper directory detection and file scanning

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

Environment variables (see `.env.example` for the full list):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (required)
- `PARALLEL_API_KEY` (required for research lookup, web search, and deep research via parallel-cli and the Parallel Chat API)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (optional, for AI image generation: schematics, figures, slides, infographics, and markitdown AI features)
- `NCBI_API_KEY` / `NCBI_EMAIL` (optional, for higher-rate PubMed lookups in literature-review scripts)

### Run

```bash
# CLI
uv run scientific-writer

# Example API usage
uv run python example_api_usage.py
```

## Testing and Quality

- Full type hints across the package
- Lint/format according to project defaults
- Validate imports and API signatures locally via example usage

## Plugin Development

### Testing Plugin Locally

For local plugin development and testing (step-by-step manual test instructions are in `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`):

1. **Create test marketplace** in the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   mkdir -p test-marketplace/.claude-plugin
   ```

2. **Configure marketplace** (`test-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) with a relative path to your local plugin checkout:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "test-marketplace",
     "owner": { "name": "K-Dense" },
     "plugins": [{
       "name": "claude-scientific-writer",
       "source": "../claude-scientific-writer",
       "description": "Scientific writing skills and CLAUDE.md initializer"
     }]
   }
   ```

   **Note**: Update the `source` path to match your local directory structure (relative to the test-marketplace directory).

3. **Add marketplace in Claude Code**:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add ../test-marketplace
   ```

4. **Install plugin** and restart Claude Code when prompted:
   ```
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer@test-marketplace
   ```

5. **Test in a project**:
   ```
   /claude-scientific-writer:scientific-writer-init
   ```
   Then verify CLAUDE.md is created, ask "What skills are available?", and try creating a short document.

### Plugin Structure Requirements

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** - Marketplace metadata; registers the plugin and lists all skill directories
- **`commands/`** - Command definitions (YAML frontmatter required)
- **`skills/`** - Skill definitions (each with SKILL.md + YAML frontmatter)
- **`templates/`** - Template files (CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md)

### Troubleshooting Plugin Installation

- **Skills not showing**: Verify each `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools) and that the skill directory is listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- **Command not working**: Check `commands/scientific-writer-init.md` exists and has proper frontmatter
- **Template not found**: Ensure `templates/CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md` is present
- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify `marketplace.json` syntax and relative path to plugin

### Adding New Skills

See the [Skill Authoring Guide](SKILL_AUTHORING.md) for the full workflow, frontmatter reference, and quality bar. In brief:

1. Create a directory in `skills/` (the canonical source of truth)
2. Add `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What the skill does and when to use it (1-3 sentences).
   allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash
   license: MIT license
   metadata:
       skill-author: K-Dense Inc.
   ---
   ```
   Note that `allowed-tools` is a space-separated string, not a YAML list.
3. Add references, scripts, assets as needed
4. Register the skill directory in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
5. Run `python scripts/sync_skills.py` to regenerate the `.claude/skills/` and `scientific_writer/.claude/skills/` mirrors (never edit the mirrors directly)
6. Test skill availability after plugin reinstall

## Release Notes

v2.13+ highlights:

- **Parallel research backend** - research lookup, web search, and deep research moved to parallel-cli and the Parallel Chat API (`PARALLEL_API_KEY`); OpenRouter is now only used for AI image generation skills

v2.7.0 highlights:

- **Claude Code Plugin Focus** - Optimized for IDE integration
- Plugin installation with `/claude-scientific-writer:scientific-writer-init`
- All skills accessible via plugin (25 as of v2.15)
- Streamlined IDE workflow

v2.0 highlights:

- Programmatic API via `generate_paper`
- Progress streaming and comprehensive JSON results
- Modular package structure with entry points
- 100% CLI backward compatibility

See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.

## Migration Guides

### v1.x -> v2.0

- CLI remains identical (`scientific-writer`)
- New package structure replaces single-file script
- For programmatic use, import from `scientific_writer`

Example:

```python
from scientific_writer import generate_paper
```

### CLI/API -> Plugin (v2.7.0)

For best IDE experience:
- Install as Claude Code plugin (recommended)
- Use `/claude-scientific-writer:scientific-writer-init` in your project
- Access all skills directly in IDE
- No CLI required for most workflows

### Research backend (v2.13+)

- Set `PARALLEL_API_KEY` to keep research lookup, web search, and deep research working
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is no longer used for research; it remains optional for the AI image generation skills
