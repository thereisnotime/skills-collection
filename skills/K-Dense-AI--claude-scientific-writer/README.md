## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.12
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required)
- PARALLEL_API_KEY (required for research lookup, web search, and deep research)
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional, for AI image generation: schematics, figures, slides, and infographics)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended) ⭐
The easiest way to use Scientific Writer is as a Claude Code plugin. See the [Plugin Installation](#-use-as-a-claude-code-plugin-recommended) section below.

#### Option 2: Install from PyPI (CLI/API Usage)
```bash
pip install scientific-writer
```

#### Option 3: Install from source with uv
```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer.git
cd claude-scientific-writer
uv sync
```

### Configure API keys
```bash
# .env file (recommended) — see .env.example for the full list
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
echo "PARALLEL_API_KEY=your_parallel_key" >> .env            # research lookup and web search
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env        # optional: AI image generation
# or export in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_key'
```

### Usage Options

#### Use as Plugin (Recommended)
After installing the plugin and running `/claude-scientific-writer:scientific-writer-init`, simply ask Claude:
```bash
> Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. Present experimental_data.csv 
  (efficiency across 5 cell lines), include Western_blot.png and flow_cytometry.png 
  showing 87% editing efficiency (p<0.001). Compare with literature benchmarks.

> Generate an NSF grant proposal presenting preliminary data from quantum_results.csv 
  (99.2% gate fidelity), circuit_topology.png, and error_rates.csv. 
  Include 5-year timeline with milestones_budget.xlsx.

> @research-lookup Find papers on mRNA vaccine efficacy (2022-2024). Compare 
  with our trial_outcomes.csv (n=500, 94% efficacy) and antibody_titers.png.
```

#### Use the CLI
```bash
# If installed via pip
scientific-writer

# If installed from source with uv
uv run scientific-writer
```

#### Use the Python API
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():
    # Detailed prompt with specific data and figures
    async for update in generate_paper(
        query=(
            "Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. "
            "Present editing_efficiency.csv (5 cell lines, n=200 cells each). "
            "Include Western blot (protein_knockout.png) showing target depletion, "
            "flow cytometry data (editing_percentages.png) with 87% efficiency in HEK293, "
            "and off_target_analysis.csv showing <0.1% off-target effects. "
            "Compare results to published Cas9 benchmarks (typically 70-75% efficiency)."
        ),
        data_files=[
            "editing_efficiency.csv",
            "protein_knockout.png",
            "editing_percentages.png",
            "off_target_analysis.csv"
        ]
    ):
        if update["type"] == "progress":
            print(f"[{update['stage']}] {update['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"✓ PDF: {update['files']['pdf_final']}")
            print(f"  Figures: {len(update.get('figures', []))} included")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🎯 Use as a Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

**Scientific Writer works best as a Claude Code (Cursor) plugin**, providing seamless access to all scientific writing capabilities directly in your IDE. No CLI required!

### Quick Start - Plugin Installation

1. **Add the plugin marketplace** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer
   ```

2. **Install the plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** when prompted.

4. **Initialize in your project**:
   ```bash
   /claude-scientific-writer:scientific-writer-init
   ```
   This creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with comprehensive scientific writing instructions and makes all 25 skills available.

5. **Start using immediately**:
   ```bash
   # Create papers with data and figures
   > Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. Present knockout_efficiency.csv

## Use with Gemini CLI and Other Agents

The skills in this repository follow the [Claude Code SKILL.md format](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Each skill is a self-contained prompt file that tells an AI agent how to perform a specific task.

### Manual approach

To use any skill with another agent (Gemini CLI, Aider, Continue, etc.):

1. Open the relevant `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` file.
2. Copy the content below the YAML frontmatter (everything after the closing `---`).
3. Paste it into your agent's system prompt, custom instructions file, or equivalent configuration.

For example, to use the `scientific-writing` skill in Gemini CLI:

```bash
# Copy skill content to Gemini CLI system prompt file
tail -n +6 skills/scientific-writing/SKILL.md > ~/.gemini/system_prompt.md
gemini "Write a Nature paper on CRISPR off-target effects"
```

### Claude Code-specific features

The following SKILL.md frontmatter fields are Claude Code-specific and can be safely ignored by other agents:

| Field | Claude Code behaviour | Other agents |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------|
| `allowed-tools` | Restricts which tools the agent may call; written as a space-separated string (e.g. `allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash`) | Ignore or map to your agent's tool-permission system |
| `hooks` | Runs shell commands before/after skill execution | Ignore or implement equivalent pre/post hooks manually |
| `version` | Used by Claude Code marketplace | Informational only |

All skill *content* (instructions, workflows, code examples) is agent-agnostic and works with any sufficiently capable LLM.

## Versioning and Publishing (short)
Use `uv` and the helper scripts:
- Bump version (keeps pyproject + __init__ in sync): `uv run scripts/bump_version.py [patch|minor|major]`
- Build and publish: `uv run scripts/publish.py` (or `--bump patch|minor|major`)
See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for prerequisites, dry runs, tagging, and verification.

## Migration

### v1.x -> v2.0
- CLI remains unchanged (scientific-writer).
- New programmatic API: from scientific_writer import generate_paper.
- Legacy single-file script is replaced by a proper package; no action needed for CLI users.

### Research backend (v2.13+)
- Research lookup, web search, and deep research now use parallel-cli and the Parallel Chat API. Set `PARALLEL_API_KEY` to keep research lookup working.
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is no longer used for research lookup. It remains optional and is only needed for the AI image generation skills (generate-image, scientific-schematics, scientific-slides, infographics, and markitdown AI features).
