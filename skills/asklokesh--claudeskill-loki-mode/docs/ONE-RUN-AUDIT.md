# One-Run Completion Audit

Empirical audit of whether ONE RUN completes the job today. Read against
committed source at `bb73addb` (branch `main`). No files were changed; this
document is the only artifact.

The demand under audit: a user hands over a PR, an issue, or a spec, and the
run completes all development, testing, and release work and hands back
completion proof, with least cost and highest task value per dollar, without
back-and-forth or failing loops.

Verdict: a default run does reach working code, a session branch, quality
gates, and an Evidence Receipt without human input. It breaks the one-run
promise in five specific places, ranked below. Two of the five are hard stops
that wait on a person. Two are missing measurements, not defects. One is the
last mile of the deliverable.

## Method notes

Every zero reported here carries a positive control, because an unproven zero
is an absent measurement rather than a finding. Controls are printed inline
with each finding. Claims are read against committed source, and each cited
function was read in full before it was judged.

Two mid-audit hypotheses were refuted by the source and are recorded in
"Refuted during this audit" so they are not re-raised.

## 1. A blocked gate escalates to a PAUSE that waits forever, with no timeout and no tty guard

Highest user pain. This is the failing loop the demand names, and in
background mode nobody is watching it.

The escalation ladder defaults are `GATE_CLEAR_LIMIT=3`,
`GATE_ESCALATE_LIMIT=5`, `GATE_PAUSE_LIMIT=10` (`autonomy/run.sh:1513-1515`).
`gate_failure_disposition` (`autonomy/run.sh:11293-11302`) returns `pause`
once a gate's consecutive-failure count reaches 10.

For code review, that disposition does this (`autonomy/run.sh:24473-24477`):

```
log_error "Gate escalation: code_review failed $cr_count times (>= $GATE_PAUSE_LIMIT) - forcing PAUSE for human intervention"
echo "PAUSE" > "${TARGET_DIR:-.}/.loki/signals/GATE_ESCALATION"
touch "${TARGET_DIR:-.}/.loki/PAUSE"
```

`check_human_intervention` (`autonomy/run.sh:25460`) sees that file and calls
`handle_pause` (`autonomy/run.sh:25690`). The wait loop
(`autonomy/run.sh:25793-25818`) is:

```
while [ "$PAUSED" = "true" ]; do
    if [ -f "$loki_dir/STOP" ]; then ... return 1; fi
    if [ ! -f "$loki_dir/PAUSE" ]; then PAUSED=false; break; fi
    if read -t 1 -n 1 2>/dev/null; then rm -f "$loki_dir/PAUSE"; PAUSED=false; break; fi
    sleep 1
done
```

There is no timeout and no maximum wait. The loop exits only on a person
removing `.loki/PAUSE`, creating `.loki/STOP`, or pressing a key. With no TTY
attached (`--bg`, a container, a CI job) the `read` can never fire, so the run
spins on `sleep 1` indefinitely.

There is no non-interactive guard on this path. Positive control: `grep -c
"-t 0" autonomy/run.sh` returns `1`, so the grep does find tty checks in this
file; the single hit is `autonomy/run.sh:22411`, inside the unrelated
spec-contradiction fast-fail. `handle_pause` has none.

Scope it honestly: perpetual mode auto-clears PAUSE and continues
(`autonomy/run.sh:25470-25500`), except when the pause came from budget
enforcement. Default mode does not auto-clear.

## 2. Gate-stuck was the only terminal that told the user nothing (FIXED)

**Partly refuted, then fixed. The original framing of this finding was wrong,
and the correction is the useful part.**

`_loki_gate_stuck` (threshold `LOKI_GATE_STUCK_THRESHOLD:-3`) compares a stable
cause line across consecutive failures. When the same gate fails for the same
reason three times the run stops rather than grinding, for static analysis,
mock integrity and mutation integrity. Each does `save_state ... 20` then
`return 20` out of `run_autonomous`. (Line numbers are deliberately omitted:
every one this section originally cited had drifted before the fix landed.
Anchor on the function names.)

**What was wrong with the original finding.** It claimed "the deliverable stays
on the session branch and the user must discover and finish it by hand".
`commit_session_changes` is commit-always by design, including on failed runs,
and both it and `create_session_pr` are called from `main()` AFTER
`run_autonomous` returns 20. `create_session_pr` then calls `print_pr_advice`
(`autonomy/lib/git-pr-advisory.sh`), which prints the branch, the `git push -u`
line and the `gh pr create` line. So the work was already committed and the push
commands already printed. Two real bounds on that: `create_session_pr` returns
early when there are no commits, and `commit_session_changes` only commits on a
Loki-minted `loki/session-*` branch.

**The defect that was real.** Gate-stuck was the ONLY terminal in
`run_autonomous` that never called `emit_completion_summary`. Every other one
does, including the council force-stop. So it wrote no COMPLETION.txt, rendered
no completion card, and sent no notification. A `--bg` user got no ping and
nothing in the one file they are told to read, and `print_pr_advice` goes to a
stdout a detached run never shows them.

**Fixed:** all three branches now call `emit_completion_summary` with their own
outcome, each outcome has a literal label arm in both `build_completion_summary`
and `print_completion_card`, and the three statuses were added to the ENT-3
terminal-failure arm so exit 20 is classified by intent rather than reached by
fall-through (the log line previously read "crash, retryable").

**Not changed, deliberately:** no PR is opened. The council force-stop carries
the comment "No on_run_complete: a force-stop must never open a 'done' PR", and
that precedent bans the PR while mandating the summary in the same breath. This
applies the precedent rather than violating it.

Guards: `tests/test-completion-outcome-labels.sh` (now fast-tier; its literal
matcher is what caught a wildcard arm that rendered correctly but read as
unlabelled), `tests/test-exit-code-contract.sh` (10 to 13 assertions), and an
executed wiring assertion in `tests/test-terminal-next-step.sh`.

## 3. There is no cost-per-completed-task anywhere; only cost per iteration

This is a missing measurement, reported plainly rather than invented.

The per-iteration writer is `autonomy/run.sh:8303-8318`, emitting
`.loki/metrics/efficiency/iteration-N.json` with `cost_usd` at
`autonomy/run.sh:8315`.

The only aggregation that divides cost by anything is
`autonomy/loki:6447`:

```
'avg_cost_per_iteration': round(total_cost / iteration_count, 2) if iteration_count > 0 else 0,
```

plus the same division at `autonomy/loki:6518`. Both denominators are
iterations, not completed tasks.

The sharpest evidence that the metric was never built: in one script,
`total_cost` is computed at `autonomy/loki:28461` and `tasks_completed` is
emitted at `autonomy/loki:28514` and printed at `autonomy/loki:28557`, about
fifty lines apart, with no division between them. Both numbers are in hand at
the same moment and are never combined.

Searched two ways. Positive control first: `grep -c "cost_usd" autonomy/loki`
returns `19`, so the file and the pattern style both resolve.

- Division by any completed or task count, across `autonomy/loki`,
  `autonomy/run.sh`, `dashboard/*.py`: only the two
  `total_cost / iteration_count` hits above.
- Identifier search for `per_task`, `per-task`, `cost_per`, `per_completed`
  across `autonomy/`, `dashboard/*.py`, `loki-ts/src/`: only
  `avg_cost_per_iteration` at `autonomy/loki:6447`.

An iteration is not a unit of delivered value. A run that solves the task in
two iterations and one that thrashes for twenty both report a healthy average
cost per iteration.

## 4. There is no task-value-per-dollar metric

Zero hits, with a positive control, searched two ways.

Positive control: `grep -rln "cost_usd" autonomy/` resolves to
`autonomy/loki`, `autonomy/run.sh`, `autonomy/context-tracker.py`, so the
recursive search reaches these trees.

- Case-insensitive `value.per.dollar`, `value_per_dollar`, `valuePerDollar`
  across `autonomy/`, `dashboard/`, `memory/`, `loki-ts/src/`: 0 hits.
- Identifier search for `task_value`, `value_score`, `roi` across
  `autonomy/`, `dashboard/`: no metric definition. Hits were unrelated
  substrings (a template line in `autonomy/quickstart.sh:136`, bundled
  `mermaid.min.js`).

Nothing computes value per dollar, and nothing defines task value as a
quantity. The closest artifact is the productivity report at
`autonomy/loki:28535-28545`, which estimates "time saved" as
`total_iterations x 15 minutes`. That is a fixed multiplier applied to
iteration count, not a measure of delivered value, and it rises with a run
that iterates more.

## 5. On the headline issue use case, the PR rests entirely on one default-on guard chain, and the teardown then tells the user to open a PR that already exists

The back-and-forth is not conversational. The agent almost never stops to ask
a question mid-run.

Searched for blocking interactive prompts two ways. Only two exist in the CLI,
both in `cmd_config_init` (`autonomy/loki:12652`): `read -p "Choice [1]: "` at
`autonomy/loki:12669`, and `autonomy/loki:12719`, which already auto-confirms
under `LOKI_AUTO_CONFIRM`, `CI`, or a non-TTY stdin. Neither is on the
`loki start` build path. The `LOKI_PROMPT_INJECTION` handling in
`check_human_intervention` is default-off and consumes input rather than
requesting it (`autonomy/run.sh:25557-25565`).

The real issue is on the founder's named use case, `loki start
owner/repo#123`. With no flags, `create_pr` and `use_worktree` both stay false:
they are set only by `--pr`, `--ship`, `--prepare-pr`, `--worktree`, or
`--detach` (`autonomy/loki:2602`, `:2616`, `:10330`, `:10383`). So the issue
path's own PR block at `autonomy/loki:10762` (`if $create_pr;`) never executes
on a bare no-flag run.

The PR therefore rests entirely on one other path: `on_run_complete`
(`autonomy/run.sh:5246`), which is default ON (`LOKI_DELEGATE_PR:-1`,
`autonomy/run.sh:5259`) and is called from the success exits
(`autonomy/run.sh:24803`, `:25025`, `:25661`). Its guard chain does hold on a
normal run: `GITHUB_PR:-false` does not trigger the early return at
`autonomy/run.sh:5263`; branch protection is on by default
(`autonomy/run.sh:8922`) and `setup_agent_branch` is called unconditionally in
`main()` (`autonomy/run.sh:26681`) before `run_autonomous` at
`autonomy/run.sh:26783`, minting `loki/session-<ts>-<pid>`
(`autonomy/run.sh:8984-8999`), so the non-default-branch guard at
`autonomy/run.sh:5296-5298` passes.

But every remaining link is a silent no-op. Missing `gh`
(`autonomy/run.sh:5279`), failing `gh auth status` (`autonomy/run.sh:5282`),
or a non-GitHub remote (`autonomy/run.sh:5287-5290`) each `return 0` with no
log line at all. On the headline use case the deliverable is the PR, and three
environment conditions can remove it without saying so.

Then the teardown contradicts itself. `create_session_pr` runs later, from
`main()` at `autonomy/run.sh:26956`, after the in-loop `on_run_complete` has
already opened the PR. It reaches `autonomy/run.sh:9175`:

```
if [ "${LOKI_AUTO_PR:-0}" != "1" ]; then
    print_pr_advice "$base" "$branch_name"
    ...
    return 0
fi
```

`print_pr_advice` (`autonomy/lib/git-pr-advisory.sh:69-111`) takes only base,
head, and dir. It consults nothing about an existing PR and unconditionally
prints "To open a pull request: git push -u origin ...". Note that
`_loki_persist_pr_url` writes the opened PR url to `.loki/state/pr-url.txt`
(`autonomy/run.sh:5242`), and repo-wide the only other references are in
`tests/test-issue-to-pr-action.sh`: nothing in the advice path reads it.

So a successful run opens the PR, folds its url into the completion summary
via `build_completion_summary` (`autonomy/run.sh:4644`, reached through
`emit_completion_summary` at `autonomy/run.sh:5064`, called at `:24804` and
`:25026`), and then prints instructions to create the PR it just created. That
is a contradictory instruction at the moment the user is deciding whether the
job is done.

The same hand-back shape appears on the pause path: the guidance written into
`PAUSED.md` (`autonomy/run.sh:25778`) tells the user to read the findings file,
fix what it names, and resume.

## What works, and should not be disturbed

Stated so the defect list is not mistaken for a verdict on the whole system.

- The Evidence Receipt is automatic, not a second command. `loki proof` is an
  inspection surface; generation happens in-run via `generate_proof_of_run`
  (`autonomy/run.sh:7926`), default on (`LOKI_PROOF:-1`), called from
  `main()` at `autonomy/run.sh:26811`, `:26895`, `:26980` and from `cleanup()`
  at `autonomy/run.sh:26016`.
- That receipt survives a gate-stuck exit 20. `autonomy/run.sh:26783` is
  `run_autonomous "$PRD_PATH" || result=$?`, which catches the 20, and the
  zombie-receipt guard at `autonomy/run.sh:26802-26812` generates the proof
  immediately after the loop returns.
- PRs that are opened carry the receipt inline: `autonomy/run.sh:5331` and
  `:9257`, plus the issue path at `autonomy/loki:10779-10793`.
- The receipt is independently re-checkable, which is the substantive answer to
  "does the user get proof they can verify." `cmd_verify` (`autonomy/loki:18131`)
  has a `--fast` path through `lib/fast_verify.py` that runs only exogenous,
  deterministic checks with no model call and no network, so any third party
  with the same commit re-derives the same verdict; the deeper route is
  `autonomy/verify.sh`. `loki proof verify <id>` (`autonomy/loki:36196`)
  re-checks a receipt for tamper and drift, with `--jwks` for attestation
  against a published key set.
- The stuck-gate valve itself is sound. `_loki_gate_stuck` skips the static
  banner and compares the first real cause line
  (`autonomy/run.sh:11132-11145`), so a run making genuine progress through
  different findings is not misread as stuck.

## Refuted during this audit

Recorded so neither is raised again.

- "`enforce_mock_integrity || true` at `autonomy/run.sh:24187` discards the
  BLOCK." False. The verdict travels via the global
  `_LOKI_MOCK_INTEGRITY_STATUS`, read on the next line
  (`autonomy/run.sh:24188`); the `fail` arm runs `track_gate_failure`,
  escalation guidance, and the `_loki_gate_stuck` abort
  (`autonomy/run.sh:24190-24228`). The `|| true` only prevents `set -e` from
  killing the script.
- "The receipt is lost on the gate-stuck path." False, refuted by
  `autonomy/run.sh:26783` and `:26810-26812` as described above.
