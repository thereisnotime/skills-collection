# Loki Mode - Architecture Overview

Spec in, verified product out. This document gives a SIMPLE view for a first read
and a FULL view for the whole machine, plus one RARV-C iteration as a sequence.

Every claim is verified against source (`autonomy/loki`, `autonomy/run.sh`,
`autonomy/completion-council.sh`, `skills/quality-gates.md`, `SKILL.md`). Line
numbers drift; function names are stable. See `CLAUDE.md` for the file map.

## SIMPLE flowchart (the whole product in five boxes)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SPEC[Spec: PRD / issue / OpenAPI / one-liner] --> LOOP[RARV-C loop]
    LOOP --> VERIFY[Verify: gates + council + evidence gate]
    VERIFY -- not done --> LOOP
    VERIFY -- verified --> SHIP[Deployed product + proof-of-run]
```

Diagram type: flowchart. 4 nodes.

Reason, Act, Reflect, Verify, then Closure. The loop does not exit until the
verify stage clears; "done" is a verdict the machine has to earn, not a claim it
gets to make.

## USER view: how you run it and what you get

```bash
# One-time: launch Claude Code with autonomous permissions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Then either say "Loki Mode", or run the CLI directly:
loki start ./prd.md            # PRD-mode (a Markdown spec file)
loki start owner/repo#123      # issue-mode (a GitHub issue)
loki start                     # one-line brief, answer the prompt
```

What happens: `loki start` (`cmd_start` in `autonomy/loki`) execs the runner
(`autonomy/run.sh`). The `run_autonomous()` loop builds a prompt each iteration
(`build_prompt()`), invokes the provider, then runs checklist verification, an app
runner, smoke tests, and code review. It stops when the completion council votes
stop (`council_should_stop` in `autonomy/completion-council.sh`), a completion
promise is met, max iterations is hit, or (v8.0.0) a failure is positively
identified as non-retryable -- bad credentials, unknown model, exhausted quota --
where further retries would be guaranteed-identical failures
(`loki-ts/src/runner/retry_class.ts`, `LOKI_SMART_RETRY=0` to disable). An
unrecognized failure stays transient and retries as before, so the early exit
can never abandon a build that would have succeeded.

The council's own force-stop valves (stagnation, repeated done-claims) are
additionally delayed by one iteration when the agent's self-reported confidence
spikes, so a sudden claim of near-certainty is VERIFIED rather than trusted
(`loki-ts/src/runner/council.ts`, v8.0.0). That delay is strictly additive: it
can only add a verification pass, never skip one, and it never delays the
stagnation valve.

What you get:
- A runnable artifact (the built product in your working directory).
- A proof-of-run: `.loki/proofs/<id>/proof.json` plus an HTML report
  (`autonomy/lib/proof-generator.py`, `autonomy/lib/proof-template.html`).
- An honest verdict. The evidence gate blocks completion on an empty diff, red
  tests, an unhealthy serveable app (runtime-boot axis), or a leaked credential in
  the changed files (secret-leak axis) - v8.0.0, `SKILL.md`.

Provider-agnostic (stable since v5.0.0): Claude (Tier 1, full), Cline (Tier 2),
Codex and Aider (Tier 3, degraded, sequential). Gemini deprecated v7.5.18. See
`skills/providers.md`.

---

## FOUNDER view: the moat

The moat is not "an agent that writes code". It is the trust layer wrapped around
the loop.

- RARV-C rigor. Every iteration is Reason, Act, Reflect, Verify, then Closure
  (findings injection, override council, learnings, handoff). The closure knobs
  are default-on in the Bun runner: `LOKI_INJECT_FINDINGS`, `LOKI_OVERRIDE_COUNCIL`,
  `LOKI_AUTO_LEARNINGS`, `LOKI_HANDOFF_MD` (`CLAUDE.md`, `skills/quality-gates.md`).
- Verify, not vibes. 8 quality gates (`skills/quality-gates.md`), a blind
  3-reviewer council with severity blocking, an anti-sycophancy Devil's Advocate on
  unanimous PASS, and a verified-completion evidence gate that blocks on positive
  fabrication evidence. The system does not call work done until it is verified
  (`SKILL.md`).
- Tier routing. Opus for planning/architecture, Sonnet for development, Haiku for
  unit tests and simple parallel work (`CLAUDE.md` Model Selection;
  `get_rarv_tier()` in `autonomy/run.sh`, session-pinned via `LOKI_SESSION_MODEL`,
  default sonnet). Cost tracks the tier, not a flat premium.
- Model-equivalence thesis (founder framing). The rigor lives in the HARNESS (the
  loop, the gates, the council, the evidence gate), not in any one model. Because
  the harness is provider-agnostic with abstract model tiers and a degraded mode
  for non-Claude providers, the trust guarantee is not tied to a single vendor
  (`SKILL.md` provider-agnostic section; `providers/*.sh`). An optional Anthropic
  Agent SDK route exists behind `LOKI_SDK_MODE` (off by default, v8.0.0); unset is
  byte-identical to the claude-CLI route (`references/sdk-mode.md`).

`get_rarv_tier()` in `autonomy/run.sh`; the 8-gate table in
`skills/quality-gates.md`; closure env vars in `CLAUDE.md`; `council_should_stop()`

## One RARV-C iteration (sequenceDiagram)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Runner as run_autonomous (run.sh)
    participant Prompt as build_prompt
    participant Provider as Provider (Claude/Codex/Cline/Aider)
    participant Verify as Gates + council
    participant Evidence as Evidence gate
    participant Council as completion council
    participant Memory as Episodic/semantic store

    Runner->>Prompt: Reason - assemble prompt (RARV, SDLC, memory, queue, checklist)
    Prompt-->>Runner: iteration prompt
    Runner->>Provider: Act - invoke provider
    Provider-->>Runner: code edits + output
    Runner->>Runner: Reflect - checklist, app runner, smoke tests
    Runner->>Verify: Verify - 8 gates + 3 blind reviewers
    Verify-->>Runner: gate verdicts (Crit/High block)
    Runner->>Runner: Closure - inject findings, override council, learnings, handoff
    Runner->>Memory: store episode trace
    Runner->>Evidence: verified-completion evidence gate
    Evidence-->>Runner: pass / block (empty-diff, red-tests, boot, secret-leak)
    Runner->>Council: council_should_stop vote
    Council-->>Runner: continue OR stop (verified)
    Note over Runner,Council: on continue, next iteration re-enters Reason with injected findings
```

Diagram type: sequenceDiagram. 7 participants, 14 messages.

Verified: the RARV cycle (Reason/Act/Reflect/Verify) is `SKILL.md` PRIORITY 2; the
Closure stage maps to the four default-on closure env vars in `CLAUDE.md`; the
evidence-gate axes and "does not call work done until verified" are `SKILL.md`
v8.0.0; the council vote is `council_should_stop` in `autonomy/completion-council.sh`.

## Where this connects

Loki Mode is the ENGINE. Its `proof.json` is the evidence that the neutral
Autonomi Verify signer stamps, and the Autonomi SaaS product is the hosted layer
that drives the engine for non-technical users. See `docs/AUTONOMI-ECOSYSTEM.md`
for the three-repo boundary map.
