Auto-Claude provides a native Electron app with:
- Kanban board for visual task tracking
- Multiple agent terminals (up to 12)
- Real-time progress visualization
- Point-and-click interface

**Loki Mode:** CLI + web dashboard with dark Vercel/Linear theme, sidebar navigation, overview cards, Completion Council views. Dashboard served on port 57374.

**Verdict: Auto-Claude wins** - GUI significantly lowers barrier to entry.

### 2. Package Distribution
Auto-Claude provides:
- Pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel + ARM), Linux
- Auto-updates

**Verdict: Auto-Claude wins** - Better workflow integration.

### 5. Interactive Controls
Auto-Claude allows:
- Ctrl+C to pause and add instructions
- HUMAN_INPUT.md for file-based intervention
- PAUSE file to pause after current session

**Loki Mode:** Limited. INTERVENTION_NEEDED signal exists but less refined.

**Verdict: Auto-Claude wins** - Better human-in-the-loop.

## Honest Assessment: Where Loki Mode is Better

### 1. Research Foundation
Loki Mode is built on peer-reviewed research:
- Anthropic: Constitutional AI, alignment detection
- DeepMind: SIMA 2, Scalable Oversight via Debate
- OpenAI: Agents SDK patterns
- Academic: CONSENSAGENT (ACL 2025), GoalAct, A-Mem/MIRIX

**Auto-Claude:** No documented research foundation.

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Academically grounded.

### 2. Specialized Agent Types
Loki Mode has 41 specialized agent roles across 8 domains - prompt-defined specifications the orchestrator adopts per phase, with parallel review (blind council) and optional worktree streams on Claude Code, sequential on other providers:
- Engineering (8): frontend, backend, database, mobile, API, QA, perf, infra
- Operations (8): DevOps, SRE, security, monitoring, incident, release, cost, compliance
- Business (8): marketing, sales, finance, legal, support, HR, investor, partnerships
- Data (3): ML, engineering, analytics
- Product (3): PM, design, tech writer
- Growth (4): hacker, community, success, lifecycle
- Review (3): code, business, security
- Orchestration (4): planner, sub-planner, judge, coordinator

**Auto-Claude:** 4 agent types: planner, coder, memory_manager, QA

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - 10x more specialized coverage.

### 3. Full SDLC Coverage
Loki Mode covers:
- Engineering (code, tests, deployment)
- Business operations (marketing, sales, legal)
- Growth (A/B testing, community, lifecycle)

**Auto-Claude:** Engineering only. No business/marketing agents.

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Full spec-to-product lifecycle vs coding only.

### 4. Anti-Sycophancy Measures
Loki Mode implements CONSENSAGENT (ACL 2025):
- Blind 3-reviewer system
- Devil's advocate on unanimous approval
- Severity-based blocking

**Auto-Claude:** Single QA loop with no anti-sycophancy checks.

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Research-backed quality assurance.

### 5. Quality Gates
Loki Mode runs 8 deterministic quality gates plus full SDLC phase coverage.

The 8 deterministic quality gates: static analysis (CodeQL, ESLint), test suite (pass/fail), blind 3-reviewer review with severity blocking, anti-sycophancy Devil's Advocate, mock-integrity, test-mutation, documentation coverage, and Magic Modules debate. (Backward-compatibility is a conditional healing-mode auditor, not a numbered gate.)

Beyond the gates, the SDLC pipeline covers these phases:
1. Static analysis (CodeQL, ESLint)
2. Unit tests (test suite passes; coverage % not measured this release)
3. API/Integration tests
4. E2E tests (Playwright)
5. Security scanning (OWASP)
6. Parallel code review (3 reviewers)
7. Performance/load testing
8. Accessibility (WCAG)
9. Regression testing
10. UAT simulation
11. Anti-sycophancy check
12. Scale-aware review intensity
13. Continuous monitoring

**Auto-Claude:** Single QA validation loop (up to 50 iterations).

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Comprehensive quality vs single loop.

### 6. Published Benchmarks
Loki Mode:
- HumanEval: 98.78% Pass@1 (162/164, reproducible harness)
- SWE-bench: not measured. A patch-generation harness exists (299/300 diffs
  produced), but the official evaluator was never run, so there is no resolve
  rate. Patch generation is not a success metric and is not comparable to
  other tools' resolution scores.

**Auto-Claude:** No published benchmarks.

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins on HumanEval transparency** - one real, reproducible
number versus none. No SWE-bench performance claim is made.

### 7. Licensing
- Loki Mode: MIT (free, no restrictions)
- Auto-Claude: AGPL-3.0 (copyleft, requires open-sourcing modifications)

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - More permissive for commercial use.

### 8. API Access
- Loki Mode: Works with Claude API (any tier)
- Auto-Claude: Requires Claude Pro/Max subscription

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Lower barrier to entry.

### 9. No External Dependencies
- Loki Mode: Pure bash/skill, no Electron, no Python backend
- Auto-Claude: Requires Python 3.9+, Node.js, Electron, specific npm packages

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Simpler, lighter footprint.

### 10. Cursor Scale Patterns (v3.3.0)
Loki Mode now incorporates proven patterns from Cursor's large-scale agent deployments:
- Recursive sub-planners
- Judge agents for cycle decisions
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Scale-aware review intensity

**Auto-Claude:** Does not document scale patterns.

**Verdict: Loki Mode wins** - Production-tested at scale.
