# Loki + Autonomi: Top-100 Backlog (Master Plan)

Generated 2026-07-01 by the top100-backlog-enumeration ultracode workflow (7 agents, 116 raw items -> 100 ranked). North star: easiest to integrate with anyone; ranked by leverage toward zero-friction adoption, modularization, enterprise-grade, and scale.

## Themes
- Trust and correctness bugs (data-loss, cross-tenant, fake-green safety)
- Autonomi Verify productization (stub -> shipped: gate/council/cost/sign wiring)
- Zero-friction adoption (reduce user setup and error surface)
- Modularization (extract libraries, break monoliths, fix import boundaries)
- Enterprise-scale and multi-tenant (RBAC/SSO/persistence/sandbox, mostly founder-gated)
- autonomi-saas evidence and proof pipeline (receipt phases, correlation, worker cutover)
- CI, test, and distribution hardening (coverage, unreachable tests, publish gates)
- Runtime-agnostic and Bun migration (bash sunset, write-path port)

## Legend
- **gate**: autonomous (I execute) | founder-gated (prep to one-approval-away) | community
- **effort**: S/M/L/XL | **value**: critical/high/medium/low

## Gate split (what can actually close autonomously) - 2026-07-01

The /goal asks to work through all 100. The honest structural reality: only a
subset is autonomously completable. The rest need a founder decision or are
community/CI-infra work that cannot be forced from this session.

- **Autonomous (I can execute end-to-end): ~25 items** (the `gate=autonomous` rows).
- **Founder-gated (blocked on a decision only the founder can make): ~35 items.**
  Licensing (#5), hosted deploy target (#6, #23, #36), enterprise RBAC/SSO (#15),
  sandbox backend choice (#14, #42), spend (#49 SWE-bench, #18 live-model), npm
  publish + brand (#4, #13, #61), telemetry (#62), GitHub App (#46). Prepped to
  one-approval-away where possible; CANNOT close without the founder.
- **Community / CI-infra (~40 items):** flake root-causes, coverage thresholds,
  platform runners (ARM64/Windows), distribution resilience. Environmental
  hardening, not single-session feature work.

### Shipped this session (accuracy-moat, from the competitive gap-analysis)

Net-new accuracy work driven from docs/research-2026-07/gap-analysis-backlog.json
(a companion list), NOT retroactive Top-100 claims:

- v7.105.0 - convergence: council evaluates on completion-claim (4.0x faster, n=3). commit b8a368a0.
- v7.106.0 - reverse-classical test provenance (tautological tests downgraded). commit 71299faa.
- v7.107.0 - loki mcp --transport http loopback bind + bearer auth (+ latent crash fix). commit f3aa523c.
- v7.108.0 - runtime boot smoke gate + annotate-before-act expectation ledger. commit 806fc374.

### Top-100 items with a concrete shipped commit

- #40 (dashboard memory summary on JSON-backed projects) - commit 330de52d.
- #22 (3 parallel code reviewers) - already present in the engine (council path).

### Next autonomous batch (by value, unblocked, user-visible)

Picked from the `autonomous` rows by value + real-user impact (not primitives that
ship dormant). Verify each before starting; several may overlap the already-built
private autonomi-verify TS engine (e.g. #7/#8 - check before rebuilding).
