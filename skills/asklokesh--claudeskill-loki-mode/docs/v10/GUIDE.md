# Loki 10 engine guide

Default: Loki 10 engine for `loki "<task>"`, `loki owner/repo#N` and `loki quick "<task>"`. Set LOKI_ENGINE=legacy or run `loki legacy <args>` for the previous engine. <!-- loki10-default -->

Loki 10 is the rewritten engine (docs/v10/ENGINE.md). Since the D48 flip it
is the default for three entry points: `loki "<task>"`, `loki owner/repo#N`
(issue mode) and `loki quick "<task>"`. Each prints one start line,
`Loki 10 engine (set LOKI_ENGINE=legacy or run 'loki legacy' for the previous
engine)`, then the summary below. Everything else (`loki start`, `loki
status`, `loki dashboard` and the rest) is unchanged unless you set
LOKI_ENGINE=v10 explicitly, which also routes status, verify and dashboard
to the v10 commands. Bare `loki verify` (no LOKI_ENGINE) follows the newest
run: when the newest entry in .loki/runs/ is a v10 run newer than the newest
legacy proof it runs the v10 verify, otherwise the legacy verify. If bun is
missing or LOKI_PROVIDER is unsupported, the default mode falls back to the
legacy engine and prints one stderr line saying why. The previous engine stays one step away:
`loki legacy <args>` and LOKI_ENGINE=legacy.

Some pieces named in this guide are still being built. Each one below says
so plainly instead of describing a finished feature.

## Quickstart

Put the task first, as a quoted multi-word string, so bin/loki's router
sends it to the v10 engine. A one-word argument that is not an issue ref,
or any first argument starting with `-`, stays on the legacy engine.

```
loki "fix the login redirect loop" --no-pr
```

`loki quick "<task>"` is the small-task entry. It runs the same engine
without opening a pull request (the legacy quick never opened one), and the
engine's own sizing picks the lean path for a small task: Plan and Wall are
skipped and implement starts on sonnet, escalating to the top model only
on a real test failure (E-64; `LOKI_E10_CASCADE=0` turns the cascade off).
`loki quick --help` and a flag-first `loki quick -v "<task>"` stay on the
legacy quick.

```
loki quick "fix the login redirect loop"
```

If bun is not installed, or LOKI_PROVIDER names a provider the v10 engine
has no invoker for (anything but claude, codex, cline, aider), these entry
points fall back to the legacy engine instead of failing.

Issue refs work the same way:

```
loki owner/repo#123
loki https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```

bin/loki routes GitHub, GitLab (`.../-/issues/N`) and Jira
(`.../browse/KEY`) issue URLs to the v10 engine, and the issue-fetch step
(autonomy/issue-providers.sh) fetches title/body/labels from all three.
Only the extra already-done check (an issue's `state` and whether it was
closed by a merged PR) is GitHub-only; a GitLab or Jira issue still runs,
just without that extra signal.

Flags, from the engine's own `--help`:

- `--no-pr`: build and verify, but skip opening a pull request.
- `--deep`: request the deep verify pass; the implement time budget goes
  from 480s to 1800s (`loki-ts/src/engine10/types.ts`).
- `--provider <name>`: pick the coding provider for this run. See the
  provider table below.

`--no-pr`, `--deep` and `--provider` are parsed by the supervisor
(`loki-ts/src/engine10/supervisor.ts`) and take effect on a real run.

`loki status`, `loki verify` and `loki dashboard` are all built on main
(status.ts, verify_cmd.ts, dashboard/server.ts) and route through cli.ts's
table like any other subcommand.

The free-text and issue-ref run itself (the supervisor that plans, builds
and verifies) is wired into the CLI on main: `loki "<task>"` and `loki
<issue-ref>` run the full worker flow (intake, plan, wall, implement,
verify, seal) and then, in the supervisor, the pr stage, ending in the
5-line summary below.

Slack is not part of the v10 engine surface (no command, no notification
hook) and is in progress, tracked with the other wave 3 items.

## The summary

A finished run prints the start line, then one label per line (Outcome,
PR, Receipt, NOT PROVEN, Cost, Time; a Reason line is added for any
outcome other than VERIFIED or ALREADY_SATISFIED). The quiet default stays
within 8 lines. The block below is the older 5-line form; the labels are the
same:

```
PR:         https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1
Verdict:    VERIFIED
NOT PROVEN: full suite, app boot, council, security scan
Cost:       $0.42 (claude, 212k tokens)
Time:       4m12s (intake 11s, plan 20s, implement 3m10s, verify 31s)
```

- **PR**: the opened pull request URL, or `none` when the run used
  `--no-pr` or never got that far. A draft PR adds the draft reason in
  parentheses.
- **Verdict**: one of VERIFIED, PARTIAL, ALREADY_SATISFIED, SPEC_CONFLICT or
  FAILED.
- **NOT PROVEN**: everything the run did not check, comma-joined. Never
  empty by omission: a check that was skipped or deferred is always listed
  here, not silently dropped. A flaky test found during verify appears as a
  separate `; flaky ...` clause on the same line.
- **Cost**: the provider-reported dollar figure and token count. When the
  provider does not report cost, this line reads `not measured` instead of
  `$0.00`; a missing cost is never rendered as free. The one exception is the
  CLI invoker (LOKI_E10_INVOKER=cli, which the first-run gate's stub uses): it
  has no dollar figure to report, so the run records 0 with the source marker
  `cli-invoker-unmetered` in the cost event, the receipt (`cost.source`) and
  the efficiency record, shows `$0.00 (...; CLI invoker records no cost)`, and
  adds `cost unmetered (CLI invoker; recorded as 0)` to NOT PROVEN. The cost
  fields are never null on such a run.
- **Time**: total wall time, then each stage's own duration in parentheses.

This formatter (`loki-ts/src/engine10/output.ts`, `formatSummary`) is
called by the supervisor at the end of every run, so a real `loki "<task>"`
or `loki <issue-ref>` run prints this block on completion. The block above
is that function's real output, not a mockup.

## NOT PROVEN

NOT PROVEN lists what a run did not verify, so a passing run is never read
as more thorough than it was. One entry is unconditional, written by Seal
every time:

- **The deep checks**: `full suite, app boot, council, security scan`.
  They are deferred to a separate deep-verify pass, so Seal always lists
  all four at seal time.

Seal also adds an entry whenever it applies, for example: `cost not
measured (no iteration ids recorded)`, `kill blocking not enforced` for
any provider other than claude, `worker killed by the supervisor backstop
(cap plus grace)`, `event log modified outside the engine`, a flaky test,
a reverted test edit, a model override a non-claude provider could not
honor, a task source the intake step did not record, an uncomputable
diff, an individual check that did not run, or a failed receipt signature.
The Cost line above separately reads `not measured` (never `$0.00`)
whenever the provider reported no dollar figure.

## Receipts

A run writes `.loki/runs/<run-id>/receipt.json` and a matching
`receipt.md`. The JSON receipt's `receipt_sha256` hashes the canonical JSON
without the `verification` block, so verifying a receipt never has to trust
its own signature field to compute the hash it is checking.

`loki verify [run-id]` re-hashes the receipt and checks its signature. A
receipt with no signing key configured (or a key that failed to load) reads
`UNSIGNED` and is never presented as attested; a signed receipt reads
`SIGNED (kid ...)`.

## Provider table

| Provider | Cost measured | Kill blocking enforced |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| claude   | yes            | yes                      |
| codex    | no             | no                       |
| cline    | no             | no                       |
| aider    | no             | no                       |
| opencode | not supported  | n/a                      |

For codex, cline and aider, a run's Cost line reads `not measured` and the
NOT PROVEN line adds the literal entry `kill blocking not enforced`
(`loki-ts/src/engine10/stages/seal.ts`). opencode is not one of engine10's
provider names (`claude`, `codex`, `cline`, `aider`); it is not supported.

## After the flip

D48 made v10 the default for `loki "<task>"`, `loki owner/repo#N` and
`loki quick "<task>"`. The previous engine stays fully reachable and
unchanged: `loki legacy <args>` (prints a short deprecation notice to
stderr, then runs exactly the pre-flip route for `<args>`) and
`LOKI_ENGINE=legacy` (the same, without the notice, for scripts). Any
LOKI_ENGINE value other than v10 or unset also keeps the legacy engine.
Nothing is removed at the flip. The one place that records which state we
are in is the marked line near the top of this file and of README.md's
Loki 10 section; it changed in the same commit as the flip.
