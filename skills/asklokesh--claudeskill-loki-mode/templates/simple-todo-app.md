# Simple Todo App

A tiny single-page todo app built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla
JavaScript in one folder. Todos are saved in the browser via localStorage so
they survive a page refresh. There is no server and no build step: opening
index.html in a browser runs the whole app.

## What it does

- Add a todo by typing a title and pressing Enter.
- List every todo with a small checkbox beside it.
- Toggle a todo done or not done by clicking its checkbox.
- Remove a todo with a delete button next to it.
- Show a friendly message when the list is empty.

Keep the whole thing minimal and readable. The goal is a quick end-to-end
build that finishes fast, not a production system.

A basic automated check or verification step confirms that add, list, toggle,
and delete behave as described before the build is called done.
