# Run the test suites that guard the files you actually changed.
#
# Why this exists. The FAST tier is the release gate, and it DEFERS the 282-suite
# shell run. Three releases in one cycle (v9.25.0, v9.25.1, v9.26.0) failed to
# publish because a check guarding a file we edited lived in a deferred suite:
# CI found it 25 minutes later, one cycle at a time. CLAUDE.md already states the
# rule -- "a check that guards the shipped artifact must run in the FAST tier" --
# but nothing enforced it for suites outside the trust core.
#
# This is the targeted middle ground: not the 26-minute FULL tier, just the
# suites that mention the files in your diff.
#
# What it CANNOT catch: a failure that depends on the CI environment differing
# from yours. v9.26.2 failed on a suite this script selects and runs, because
# `yq` is preinstalled on the ubuntu-24.04 runner and absent on macOS, so the
# assertion passed locally and failed there. Running the right suite is
# necessary, not sufficient -- an environment-conditional assertion has to name
# its condition (`command -v yq`) rather than assume the author's machine.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/guard-changed.sh              # vs origin/main
#   bash scripts/guard-changed.sh HEAD~3       # vs an explicit base
#
# Exit: 0 when every matched suite passes (or none matched), 1 otherwise.
