# plan: the diff BASE...HEAD goes through scripts/select-tests.sh (the one
# shared file-to-suite mapping). Files that make the selector answer R0 (a
# broad-blast-radius or unknown-shape path) are NOT expanded to the full suite
# here; they are mapped to the structural guards that name that path
# (workflows, docker/Dockerfiles, package manifests, tests/lib, dist). The rest of
# the diff still gets its normal R1-R6 selection. The ONLY full-set fallback
# is a diff that cannot be computed (unparseable), which writes FULL.
#
# plan.tsv columns: kind, target, estimated seconds, shard. Estimated seconds
# come from tests/shard-durations.tsv (measured), default 8s for an unknown
# suite. The shard count is chosen so each shard targets <= 60s of estimate.
# A plan whose total estimate cannot fit MAX_SHARDS shards at that target
# (ceil(total/target) > MAX_SHARDS) would overflow every shard's job timeout, so
# it fails safe to FULL (plan-over-capacity) instead of packing.
# Anything the fast gate skips is covered by the nightly full run (D90).
