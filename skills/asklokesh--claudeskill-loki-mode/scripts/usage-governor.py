"""Usage governor for the Loki v10 swarm (D39, docs/v10/DECISIONS.md).

Answers three questions for the Chief of Staff's dispatch loop: how much of
the Claude Max plan's 5-hour and weekly windows has been used, what the
burn rate projects for the next hour, and how many engineers that leaves
room for. stdlib only.

## Step 2: does Claude Code expose plan usage directly?

Yes, partially. The statusLine JSON schema (fetched from
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline on 2026-09-28) documents:

  rate_limits.five_hour.used_percentage   (0-100)
  rate_limits.five_hour.resets_at         (unix epoch seconds)
  rate_limits.seven_day.used_percentage   (0-100)
  rate_limits.seven_day.resets_at         (unix epoch seconds)

"The rate_limits object is only present for claude.ai Pro and Max
subscribers ... and only after the first API response" in a session, and it
is delivered by Claude Code invoking whatever command is configured as
`statusLine` on every status-line render.

That makes it a genuine ground-truth source, but NOT independently
scriptable: there is no CLI subcommand or `claude rate-limit-status` that
this script can call on demand. It is push-based (Claude Code pushes JSON
to the configured statusLine command) and only exists while an interactive
session with a first API response is live. The `/usage` slash command is
documented as an interactive TUI screen (usage bars, attribution, `d`/`w`
toggle) with no non-interactive/JSON flag; `/usage-credits` explicitly
refuses to run under `-p`, and nothing in the costs doc claims `/usage`
does either, so it is not scriptable.

Given that, this script treats the live source as OPTIONAL and opt-in: if
the operator points their own statusLine command at a logger that appends
`{"ts": <epoch>, "rate_limits": {...}}` lines to LIVE_LOG_PATH (below), this
script prefers that as ground truth (source "live") when the newest line is
fresh (within LIVE_FRESHNESS_SECONDS). Nothing in ~/.claude/settings.json is
touched by this script -- wiring the statusLine hook up is a separate,
explicit choice for the operator. Absent that, usage falls back to the D39
calibration path (step 3) fit against founder-supplied readings.

## Calibration (step 3, when no live source)

docs/v10/usage-readings.tsv holds founder readings: utc_time, window_percent
(5-hour), weekly_percent (7-day). For each reading we sum token usage over
its matching window from the JSONL transcripts, then fit tokens-per-percent
as a least-squares line through the origin (tokens = rate * percent), which
reduces to a plain ratio for a single reading. We fit this twice: once for
raw output tokens, once for an "opus-weighted total" that scales opus output
tokens up relative to sonnet/haiku/fable, because D39 states "opus draws
faster than sonnet" against the plan limit. OPUS_WEIGHT below is a named,
commented ASSUMPTION pending real dual-model readings to calibrate it.

Every derived percentage is labelled "ESTIMATE (n=<readings>)". With zero
readings the script prints "uncalibrated" and no percentage, per spec.
