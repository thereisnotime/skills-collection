# Selection is scripts/select-tests.sh (the one shared file-to-suite mapping).
# Only shell_test and moat suites run here; static checks, bun and pytest stay
# with the slice's own gate. Each suite runs under `timeout -k`, up to

# every selected suite recorded a result (fail closed).
# R0 (run everything) is reported and NOT run: the full Tier B run owns that.
