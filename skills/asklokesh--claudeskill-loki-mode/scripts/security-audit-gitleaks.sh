# E-114: the "gitleaks scan (all reachable history)" step of
# .github/workflows/security-audit.yml's secret-scan job, factored out so
# tests/test-security-audit-config.sh can drive it against disposable scratch
# repos with the real pinned gitleaks binary. The workflow step calls this
# script unchanged; nothing here is CI-only.
#
# THE BUG THIS CLOSES: `gitleaks git .` run from the checkout root auto-loads
# THAT CHECKOUT'S OWN .gitleaks.toml (gitleaks' documented precedence:
# -c/--config, then env GITLEAKS_CONFIG, then env GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML, then
# <target path>/.gitleaks.toml, else its embedded default). A pushed commit
# that ships a zero-rule .gitleaks.toml (`title = "x"`) therefore disables
# secret scanning for THAT SAME PUSH. A reviewer reproduced this against the
# pre-push hook (E-110); the same mechanism applies to CI, which loads the
# checkout's own .gitleaks.toml with no --config at all.
#
# Two independent controls, both fail-closed, neither auto-bypassable:
#   1. refuse the job outright if the pushed range touches .gitleaks.toml at
#      all -- that change needs founder review through a dedicated PR;
#   2. even so, never trust the TIP's .gitleaks.toml for the scan itself --
#      use the BASE commit's config, or gitleaks' built-in default rules if
#      the base has none, regardless of what the tip added or changed.
# A .gitleaksignore addition is not blocked (exact-fingerprint allowlisting
# after triage is the sanctioned path) but every added line is printed as a
# ::warning:: so a reviewer sees it.

# VERSION gets no audit at all, so github.event.before (or a PR's
# base.sha) can name an UNAUDITED, attacker-controlled commit. r1 trusted
# that commit's own tree directly: push A adds a zero-rule .gitleaks.toml

# commit a leak; GITLEAKS_BEFORE=B1 printed "no leaks found", exit 0.
#
# The only commits this workflow has ever actually scanned are tagged
# releases (vX.Y.Z, cut only after local-ci and this same audit pass) --
# never a raw push. So the trusted base is ALWAYS the nearest release tag,
# located by walking ancestry backward from an anchor. GITLEAKS_BEFORE's
# OWN TREE IS NEVER READ: it is only a place to start that walk (needed so
# a PR's base branch, not its unmerged head, is where the walk begins).
# Neither A nor any other untagged commit matches `--match 'v[0-9]*'`, so
# the walk always lands on the last real release no matter how many
# unaudited interim pushes sit in between -- or how many hops back it
# takes to find one, unlike a single `^` parent step.

# diff already IS "refuse any tip .gitleaks.toml unless byte-identical to
# the file at the last release tag" -- today that file does not exist at
# the base, so ANY .gitleaks.toml on the tip differs and is refused.
#
# A NET two-endpoint diff (base tree vs tip tree), not a per-commit walk. A
# per-commit `diff-tree -m` walk over a MERGE commit compares the merge
# result against EACH parent separately, so it flags .gitleaks.toml as
# "added" against whichever parent forked before the config existed -- true
# of every ordinary train merge of a slice branch older than the config
# (this repo's own history, e.g. f6c3add4) -- even though nothing about the
# config actually changed net. Control (2) below never loads the tip's
# config regardless, so only a NET change between base and tip can affect
# what a later push trusts as its base; a config added then removed inside
# the same range nets to "unchanged" and is correctly not a concern here.
# The job is refused below, AFTER the scan runs (2) -- not here -- so a
# refused push still produces a report the Upload step can attach, and so
# the trusted-base-config scan gets to prove itself on the same range
# independently of this gate (defense in depth: even if this detection had
# a bug, (2) alone still never trusts the tip's config).
