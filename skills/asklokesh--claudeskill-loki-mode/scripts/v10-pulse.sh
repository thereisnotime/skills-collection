# scripts/v10-pulse.sh -- deterministic anti-drift status/violation reporter
# for the v10 swarm (docs/v10/SWARM.md, docs/v10/BOARD.md, docs/v10/CONTROL.md).
# No model calls. Prints a status block to stdout, then a NEXT ACTIONS block
# if any VIOLATION fired.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 -- clean (no violation, every metric known)
#   1 -- at least one VIOLATION fired
#   2 -- no VIOLATION, but at least one metric came back UNKNOWN (a crashed
#        or timed-out sub-check must never read as clean)
# ponytail: a hook wrapper (`bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh || true`) is a
# separate step's job, not this script's -- this script's own contract only
# needs to be honest about 0 vs 1 vs 2.
#
# This is a thin bash wrapper around one embedded python3 -E program: all
# parsing, date math, stat calls and subprocess timeouts live there, so bash
# 3.2 (macOS default /bin/bash) is trivially safe -- there is almost nothing
# here for a bashism to break.
#
# Every external data source is env-var overridable, matching this repo's
# ${VAR:-default} convention (see autonomy/run.sh: LOKI_SESSION_MODEL,
# LOKI_ORIGINAL_SCRIPT_DIR), so tests fully control inputs with no real
# npm/gh/git network or wall-clock dependency:
#   BOARD_MD            path to BOARD.md (default: docs/v10/BOARD.md)
#   CONTROL_MD          path to CONTROL.md (default: docs/v10/CONTROL.md)
#   PULSE_REPO_ROOT     repo root for git operations (default: this repo)
#   PULSE_MAIN_REF      the ref to treat as "main" (default: main) -- used for
#                       CI status, unreleased-merge age and the moat baseline,
#                       so this script gives an honest answer about the swarm's
#                       main line even when run from a builder worktree whose
#                       own HEAD is a feature branch.
#   PULSE_NPM_CMD       npm command to run (default: npm view loki-mode time --json)
#   PULSE_GH_CMD        gh command to run (default: gh run list --branch main
#                       --commit <main-sha> --json status,conclusion,workflowName --limit 20)
#   PULSE_GH_STREAK_CMD gh command for the CI_CANCELLED_STREAK check (default:
#                       gh run list --branch main --workflow Tests --json
#                       status,conclusion --limit 10). Independent of
#                       PULSE_GH_CMD/main_sha on purpose -- it must still run
#                       (and be able to fire) even when the main-CI-status
#                       lookup above cannot resolve a SHA and reads UNKNOWN.
#   PULSE_WORKTREE_CMD  git worktree list command (default: git worktree list --porcelain)
#   PULSE_MOAT_RESULT   path to a file holding the real captured stdout of a
#                       `bash tests/moat/run.sh` run (its own summary lines
#                       are parsed: "moat: N of 9 properties proven" and, on
#                       failure, "moat suite: FAIL (K rule failure(s))").
#                       This is the ONLY source MOAT_REGRESSION trusts: the
#                       pending.txt-derived count is ratchet-only (its id set
#                       can only shrink release over release, per
#                       tests/moat/run.sh's own contract) and so can never by
#                       itself register a real regression -- it is shown as
#                       informational context only. With no PULSE_MOAT_RESULT
#                       (or an unreadable/unparseable one), MOAT_REGRESSION
#                       reports UNKNOWN rather than silently falling back to
#                       the pending-derived count.
#                       SHA pinning (BACKLOG 133): a result file alone is not
#                       enough -- it must also prove which commit it was
#                       measured against. The writer MUST also write a
#                       sidecar file at "<PULSE_MOAT_RESULT>.sha" holding
#                       exactly the full 40-char SHA the tree was at when
#                       `tests/moat/run.sh` was run (no trailing content, no
#                       short SHA, no ref name -- compared byte-for-byte,
#                       never re-resolved through git). Capture the SHA and
#                       require a clean tree BEFORE running the suite, not
#                       after: `tests/moat/run.sh` takes minutes, in which
#                       time HEAD can move (another process, a background
#                       swarm run) and a dirty tree means HEAD's SHA does not
#                       actually describe what was measured. Typical use:
#                         git diff --quiet HEAD || exit 1
#                         moat_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
#                         bash tests/moat/run.sh > moat-result.txt
#                         printf '%s\n' "$moat_sha" > moat-result.txt.sha
#                         PULSE_MOAT_RESULT=moat-result.txt bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh
#                       This script compares that sidecar's contents against
#                       PULSE_MAIN_REF's current resolved HEAD. A missing/
#                       empty sidecar (an older-style capture with no
#                       provenance) or a mismatched SHA (a stale capture from
#                       an earlier commit) both report UNKNOWN with a clear
#                       reason -- never a confident clean/regression verdict
#                       from input that cannot be proven current.
#   PULSE_SWARM_START   swarm start time override, epoch seconds or ISO8601

#                       never the release tag -- a release can lag a push by

#                       PULSE_PUSH_LOG_DIR.
#   PULSE_PUSH_LOG_DIR  directory to look for push-*.log files in for the
#                       PULSE_LAST_TRAIN_PUSH fallback above (default:
#                       ~/loki-ci-logs, where scripts/v10-ops.sh push-main
#                       and the swarm's train-push tooling write their logs).
#   PULSE_PYTHON        python3 interpreter to use (default: python3)
#   PULSE_DEADLINE_SECS network-call time budget in seconds for npm+gh
#                       together (default: 3; the calls run concurrently, so
#                       this is also the per-call cap). git/worktree calls
#                       use a separate small fixed cap.
#   PULSE_CACHE         "0" disables the network cache below (default: on).
#   PULSE_CACHE_DIR     cache directory (default: $PULSE_REPO_ROOT/.loki/pulse-cache,
#                       gitignored via .loki/).
#   PULSE_LOAD_MAX      HIGH_LOAD threshold override (default: 28, 2x 14 cores).
#   PULSE_LOADAVG       overrides the 1-minute load average reading (default:
#                       `sysctl -n vm.loadavg` on macOS, /proc/loadavg on Linux).
#   PULSE_PS_OUTPUT     overrides `ps -eo pid,ppid,etime,command` for
#                       ORPHAN_TEST and ORPHAN_WORKTREE (same listing, both
#                       checks scan it independently).
#   PULSE_ORPHAN_WORKTREE_MAX_MIN
#                       age threshold in minutes for ORPHAN_WORKTREE (default
#                       30): a process older than this whose command line
#                       references a .claude/worktrees/ path or a
#                       /tmp/loki-run-*.sh script fires (E-00: a `timeout N
#                       bash .../agent-<id>/autonomy/run.sh` that ignored
#                       SIGTERM ran over 24h and ORPHAN_TEST's own tests/*
#                       regex never saw it).
#   PULSE_DOCKER_PS     overrides the docker container listing for
#                       STRAY_CONTAINER (see that check's own docstring for
#                       the tab-separated row shape).
#   PULSE_WORKTREE_LIST overrides `git worktree list --porcelain` for
#                       WORKTREE_COUNT (a raw porcelain listing, same shape
#                       as PULSE_WORKTREE_CMD's default output).
#   PULSE_RELEASE_TESTS overrides the gh-run-list JSON RELEASE_ON_RED reads
#                       for the newest VERSION-bump commit's Tests conclusion
#                       (default: read from S-104's gh_ci cache).
#   PULSE_PROGRESS_MD   path to PROGRESS.md for STALE_PROGRESS (default:
#                       docs/v10/PROGRESS.md). Its newest "## <ISO
#                       timestamp>Z" heading is the last-entry time; a
#                       missing file or no parseable heading reports UNKNOWN,
#                       never a false clean.
#
# Network cache (S-104: this runs as a UserPromptSubmit hook on every prompt,
# on a machine with ~16 concurrent agents, and a 15s hook timeout was being
# hit). When no PULSE_NPM_CMD/PULSE_GH_CMD/PULSE_GH_STREAK_CMD override is
# set (i.e. real npm/gh), the status run NEVER makes a network call: it reads
# the last successful npm/gh results from PULSE_CACHE_DIR. A result older than
# 90s is shown as STALE with its age (never as fresh), older than 1h or absent
# (or, for main CI, recorded against a different main SHA) is UNKNOWN. Any
# stale/missing entry starts ONE detached background refresh (this same
# script with PULSE_REFRESH_ONLY=1, PID recorded in refresh.pid, each call
# capped at PULSE_DEADLINE_SECS) whose result the next prompt sees. A failed
# refresh call never overwrites a good cached value; it just ages into STALE.
# With any override set (every test in tests/test-v10-pulse.sh), the calls
# run synchronously exactly as before, so fixtures are never cache-polluted.

# tests/moat/pending.txt's own documented invariant (see tests/moat/run.sh) is
# a ratchet: a property's failing-case IDs are removed once truly fixed, never
# added back, so the SET of pending ids can only shrink release over release.
# That means a "proven" count inferred purely from "zero pending ids for Pn"
# can only ever stay flat or INCREASE from an older ref to a newer one -- it
# is structurally unable to register a real regression, even while
# tests/moat/run.sh itself reports a live FAIL with an unlisted
# "REGRESSION: ... FAIL but not listed in tests/moat/pending.txt" line (a
# property can have zero pending.txt lines at BOTH the baseline tag and HEAD
# while its suite fails live in between -- verified on this repo: pulse's old
# pending-only heuristic read "3 of 9 proven" while `bash tests/moat/run.sh`
# reported "2 of 9 proven, FAIL (3 rule failures)" for the identical commit,
# because P7 has no pending.txt line at either ref).
#
# So MOAT_REGRESSION below never uses the pending-derived count as its source
# of truth -- only PULSE_MOAT_RESULT, which must point to a file holding the
# real captured stdout of a `tests/moat/run.sh` run (its own summary lines are
# parsed verbatim: "moat: N of 9 properties proven" and, when the suite
# failed, "moat suite: FAIL (K rule failure(s))"). Typical use (SHA captured
# BEFORE the run, see the header comment's BACKLOG 133 note on why):
#   git diff --quiet HEAD || exit 1
#   moat_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
#   bash tests/moat/run.sh > /path/to/moat-result.txt   # takes minutes
#   printf '%s\n' "$moat_sha" > /path/to/moat-result.txt.sha
#   PULSE_MOAT_RESULT=/path/to/moat-result.txt bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh
# Re-running the suite inside this script's own ~9s budget is not an option
# (the suite alone takes minutes), so when no result file is supplied, or it
# cannot be read, or its summary lines cannot be parsed, MOAT_REGRESSION is
# reported UNKNOWN rather than silently falling back to the pending-derived
# approximation as if it were a real measurement -- that fallback was the
# original bug. The pending-derived count is still shown, but only as
# informational context, explicitly labelled as not suite-verified, and it
# never feeds a violation.
#
# BACKLOG 133 (SHA pinning): a real, parseable PULSE_MOAT_RESULT is still not
# enough on its own -- nothing ties it to the commit it was measured against,
# so a stale capture from an earlier commit would read as clean today. The
# required sidecar "<PULSE_MOAT_RESULT>.sha" (see the header comment) must
# hold exactly the full SHA `tests/moat/run.sh` was measured at; this script
# compares it byte-for-byte against `git rev-parse MAIN_REF`'s current
# resolved HEAD (never re-resolved through git -- a ref name or short SHA in
# the sidecar simply fails the equality check rather than being trusted). A
# missing/empty sidecar or a mismatch both demote an otherwise-parseable
# result to UNKNOWN, deliberately fail-closed: a capture with no provenance,
# or provably stale provenance, must never register as a confident verdict.

# `+++`), over the last 20 commits on MAIN_REF touching docs/v10/BOARD.md or
# docs/v10/PROGRESS.md -- hardcoded relative paths, like
# moat_baseline_at_last_release's "tests/moat/pending.txt" above, since a
