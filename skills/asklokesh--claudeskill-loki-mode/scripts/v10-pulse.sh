# scripts/v10-pulse.sh -- deterministic anti-drift status/violation reporter
# for the v10 swarm (docs/v10/SWARM.md, docs/v10/BOARD.md, docs/v10/CONTROL.md).
# No model calls. Prints a status block to stdout, then a NEXT ACTIONS block
# if any VIOLATION fired.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 -- clean (no violation, every metric known)
#   1 -- at least one VIOLATION fired
#   2 -- no VIOLATION, but at least one metric came back UNKNOWN (a crashed
#        or timed-out sub-check must never read as clean)
# ponytail: a hook wrapper (`bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh || true`) is a
# separate step's job, not this script's -- this script's own contract only
# needs to be honest about 0 vs 1 vs 2.
#
# This is a thin bash wrapper around one embedded python3 -E program: all
# parsing, date math, stat calls and subprocess timeouts live there, so bash
# 3.2 (macOS default /bin/bash) is trivially safe -- there is almost nothing
# here for a bashism to break.
#
# Every external data source is env-var overridable, matching this repo's
# ${VAR:-default} convention (see autonomy/run.sh: LOKI_SESSION_MODEL,
# LOKI_ORIGINAL_SCRIPT_DIR), so tests fully control inputs with no real
# npm/gh/git network or wall-clock dependency:
#   BOARD_MD            path to BOARD.md (default: docs/v10/BOARD.md)
#   CONTROL_MD          path to CONTROL.md (default: docs/v10/CONTROL.md)
#   PULSE_REPO_ROOT     repo root for git operations (default: this repo)
#   PULSE_MAIN_REF      the ref to treat as "main" (default: main) -- used for
#                       CI status, unreleased-merge age and the moat baseline,
#                       so this script gives an honest answer about the swarm's
#                       main line even when run from a builder worktree whose
#                       own HEAD is a feature branch.
#   PULSE_NPM_CMD       npm command to run (default: npm view loki-mode time --json)
#   PULSE_GH_CMD        gh command to run (default: gh run list --branch main
#                       --commit <main-sha> --json status,conclusion,workflowName --limit 20)
#   PULSE_GH_STREAK_CMD gh command for the CI_CANCELLED_STREAK check (default:
#                       gh run list --branch main --workflow Tests --json
#                       status,conclusion --limit 10). Independent of
#                       PULSE_GH_CMD/main_sha on purpose -- it must still run
#                       (and be able to fire) even when the main-CI-status
#                       lookup above cannot resolve a SHA and reads UNKNOWN.
#   PULSE_GOVERNOR_CMD  command producing scripts/usage-governor.py --json
#                       output, for OPUS_SHARE/BUDGET_BURN (default: python3
#                       scripts/usage-governor.py --json). Cached the same
#                       90s way as PULSE_NPM_CMD/PULSE_GH_CMD below (S-104:
#                       interactive pulse reads cache only, a stale/missing
#                       entry starts the same detached background refresh).
#   PULSE_GOVERNOR_DEADLINE_SECS  wall-clock cap on the governor's own call
#                       inside that detached background refresh (default 45).
#                       Independent of PULSE_DEADLINE_SECS/NETWORK_DEADLINE:
#                       the governor scans every JSONL transcript under
#                       ~/.claude/projects, which measured ~125s on this
#                       repo's own real usage -- far slower than npm/gh, and
#                       never awaited by the interactive hook, so it gets a
#                       longer, separate ceiling instead of sharing npm/gh's
#                       short one. A host slower than this ceiling reads
#                       OPUS_SHARE/BUDGET_BURN as UNKNOWN until the governor
#                       itself is optimized or scoped narrower (a finding for
#                       G-01/usage-governor.py, not something this pulse
#                       check can paper over).
#   PULSE_WORKTREE_CMD  git worktree list command (default: git worktree list --porcelain)
#   PULSE_MOAT_RESULT   path to a file holding the real captured stdout of a
#                       `bash tests/moat/run.sh` run (its own summary lines
#                       are parsed: "moat: N of 9 properties proven" and, on
#                       failure, "moat suite: FAIL (K rule failure(s))").
#                       This is the ONLY source MOAT_REGRESSION trusts: the
#                       pending.txt-derived count is ratchet-only (its id set
#                       can only shrink release over release, per
#                       tests/moat/run.sh's own contract) and so can never by
#                       itself register a real regression -- it is shown as
#                       informational context only. With no PULSE_MOAT_RESULT
#                       (or an unreadable/unparseable one), MOAT_REGRESSION
#                       reports UNKNOWN rather than silently falling back to
#                       the pending-derived count.
#                       SHA pinning (BACKLOG 133): a result file alone is not
#                       enough -- it must also prove which commit it was
#                       measured against. The writer MUST also write a
#                       sidecar file at "<PULSE_MOAT_RESULT>.sha" holding
#                       exactly the full 40-char SHA the tree was at when
#                       `tests/moat/run.sh` was run (no trailing content, no
#                       short SHA, no ref name -- compared byte-for-byte,
#                       never re-resolved through git). Capture the SHA and
#                       require a clean tree BEFORE running the suite, not
#                       after: `tests/moat/run.sh` takes minutes, in which
#                       time HEAD can move (another process, a background
#                       swarm run) and a dirty tree means HEAD's SHA does not
#                       actually describe what was measured. Typical use:
#                         git diff --quiet HEAD || exit 1
#                         moat_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
#                         bash tests/moat/run.sh > moat-result.txt
#                         printf '%s\n' "$moat_sha" > moat-result.txt.sha
#                         PULSE_MOAT_RESULT=moat-result.txt bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh
#                       This script compares that sidecar's contents against
#                       PULSE_MAIN_REF's current resolved HEAD. A missing/
#                       empty sidecar (an older-style capture with no
#                       provenance) or a mismatched SHA (a stale capture from
#                       an earlier commit) both report UNKNOWN with a clear
#                       reason -- never a confident clean/regression verdict
#                       from input that cannot be proven current.
#   PULSE_SWARM_START   swarm start time override, epoch seconds or ISO8601
#   PULSE_NOW           "now" override, epoch seconds or ISO8601
#   PULSE_LAST_TRAIN_PUSH override for the last train-push time (TRAIN_LATE,
#                       D27 item 6), epoch seconds or ISO8601. Deliberately
#                       never the release tag -- a release can lag a push by
#                       minutes (see NO_RECENT_RELEASE's separate 90-minute
#                       budget for that). With no override, falls back to the
#                       reflog time of PULSE_TRAIN_PUSH_REF (a local `git
#                       push` moves it, and so does a `git fetch` that pulls
#                       in someone else's push -- the real meaning of "last
#                       train push"), then to the mtime of the newest
#                       push-*.log file under PULSE_PUSH_LOG_DIR.
#   PULSE_TRAIN_PUSH_REF the ref whose reflog is read for the
#                       PULSE_LAST_TRAIN_PUSH fallback above (default:
#                       refs/remotes/origin/main). Overridable for tests
#                       only; production never needs to change it.
#   PULSE_PUSH_LOG_DIR  directory to look for push-*.log files in for the
#                       reflog-less fallback above (default: ~/loki-ci-logs,
#                       where scripts/v10-ops.sh push-main and the swarm's
#                       train-push tooling write their logs). Only reached
#                       when PULSE_TRAIN_PUSH_REF has no reflog.
#   PULSE_PYTHON        python3 interpreter to use (default: python3)
#   PULSE_DEADLINE_SECS network-call time budget in seconds for npm+gh
#                       together (default: 3; the calls run concurrently, so
#                       this is also the per-call cap). git/worktree calls
#                       use a separate small fixed cap.
#   PULSE_CACHE         "0" disables the network cache below (default: on).
#   PULSE_CACHE_DIR     cache directory (default: $PULSE_REPO_ROOT/.loki/pulse-cache,
#                       gitignored via .loki/).
#   PULSE_LOAD_MAX      HIGH_LOAD threshold override (default: 28, 2x 14 cores).
#   PULSE_LOADAVG       overrides the 1-minute load average reading (default:
#                       `sysctl -n vm.loadavg` on macOS, /proc/loadavg on Linux).
#   PULSE_PS_OUTPUT     overrides `ps -eo pid,ppid,etime,command` for
#                       ORPHAN_TEST and ORPHAN_WORKTREE (same listing, both
#                       checks scan it independently).
#   PULSE_ORPHAN_WORKTREE_MAX_MIN
#                       age threshold in minutes for ORPHAN_WORKTREE (default
#                       30): a process older than this whose command line
#                       references a .claude/worktrees/ path or a
#                       /tmp/loki-run-*.sh script fires (E-00: a `timeout N
#                       bash .../agent-<id>/autonomy/run.sh` that ignored
#                       SIGTERM ran over 24h and ORPHAN_TEST's own tests/*
#                       regex never saw it).
#   PULSE_DOCKER_PS     overrides the docker container listing for
#                       STRAY_CONTAINER (see that check's own docstring for
#                       the tab-separated row shape).
#   PULSE_WORKTREE_LIST overrides `git worktree list --porcelain` for
#                       WORKTREE_COUNT and STRAY_WORKTREE (a raw porcelain
#                       listing, same shape as PULSE_WORKTREE_CMD's default
#                       output).
#   PULSE_RELEASE_TESTS overrides the gh-run-list JSON RELEASE_ON_RED reads
#                       for the newest VERSION-bump commit's Tests conclusion
#                       (default: read from S-104's gh_ci cache).
#   PULSE_PROGRESS_MD   path to PROGRESS.md for STALE_PROGRESS (default:
#                       docs/v10/PROGRESS.md). Its newest "## <ISO
#                       timestamp>Z" heading is the last-entry time; a
#                       missing file or no parseable heading reports UNKNOWN,
#                       never a false clean.
#   PULSE_TRANSCRIPT_DIR overrides the directory of session transcript files
#                       scanned for SESSION_STALLED (default:
#                       ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>, Claude Code's own
#                       session JSONL directory; slug = the MAIN repo root's
#                       realpath (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so a
#                       subdirectory or a linked worktree resolves the same)
#                       with every non-alphanumeric character replaced by
#                       '-', the same rule autonomy/context-tracker.py's
#                       derive_project_slug uses). The newest *.jsonl mtime
#                       under this directory is "last assistant turn". A
#                       missing/unreadable directory, or one with no *.jsonl
#                       file, reports UNKNOWN, never a false clean.
#   PULSE_LOOP_MARKER   path to the loop-active marker file for
#                       SESSION_STALLED (default:
#                       $PULSE_REPO_ROOT/.loki/state/loop-active). Written
#                       with a UTC timestamp by whoever runs the /loop,
#                       refreshed every iteration (only its mtime is read).
#                       SESSION_STALLED only evaluates while this file's
#                       mtime is under 24h old, so an abandoned marker from
#                       an earlier /loop run can never keep this check firing
#                       after the loop has actually stopped. No marker (or
#                       one 24h+ old): reports n/a, never a violation and
#                       never UNKNOWN.
#
# Network cache (S-104: this runs as a UserPromptSubmit hook on every prompt,
# on a machine with ~16 concurrent agents, and a 15s hook timeout was being
# hit). When no PULSE_NPM_CMD/PULSE_GH_CMD/PULSE_GH_STREAK_CMD override is
# set (i.e. real npm/gh), the status run NEVER makes a network call: it reads
# the last successful npm/gh results from PULSE_CACHE_DIR. A result older than
# 90s is shown as STALE with its age (never as fresh), older than 1h or absent
# (or, for main CI, recorded against a different main SHA) is UNKNOWN. Any
# stale/missing entry starts ONE detached background refresh (this same
# script with PULSE_REFRESH_ONLY=1, PID recorded in refresh.pid, each call
# capped at PULSE_DEADLINE_SECS) whose result the next prompt sees. A failed
# refresh call never overwrites a good cached value; it just ages into STALE.
# With any override set (every test in tests/test-v10-pulse.sh), the calls
# run synchronously exactly as before, so fixtures are never cache-polluted.

# "Last train push time" is deliberately NEVER the release tag (a release
# can lag its push by minutes -- see NO_RECENT_RELEASE's own separate

#   1. PULSE_LAST_TRAIN_PUSH override (epoch seconds or ISO8601) -- same
#      override convention as PULSE_NOW/PULSE_SWARM_START, and what every
#      test below uses.
#   2. The reflog time of PULSE_TRAIN_PUSH_REF (default
#      refs/remotes/origin/main), read with `git reflog show`. This ref
#      moves on every plain `git push` to origin main -- how every train is
#      actually pushed -- and on a `git fetch` that brings in someone else's
#      push, with no network call of this script's own: reading an existing
#      local reflog is a local git operation like every other `git()` call
#      here, never a `git fetch`.
#   3. The mtime of the newest push-*.log file under PULSE_PUSH_LOG_DIR
#      (default ~/loki-ci-logs), for a repo with no such reflog (a fresh
#      clone, a shallow checkout, or a pruned reflog).

# D37: cut a release at :00/:20/:40 whenever main is green and at least one
# merged-unreleased slice commit exists; never let more than 25 minutes pass
# with both conditions true. Deliberately its own check rather than a
# TRAIN_LATE rename: TRAIN_LATE clocks from the last actual `git push` (a
# push-side signal, independent of CI), while RELEASE_CADENCE clocks from
# the merged work itself (a release-readiness signal) and, per D37's own
# text, requires CI green -- a red main with old merged commits is not a
# cadence violation, it is CI_RED's problem (already highest priority).
#
# Definition of "merged-unreleased slice commit": one entry per node on
# MAIN_REF's own --first-parent chain since the tag (same walk
# check_unreleased_merge_age above already uses, and for the same reason --
# without --first-parent this walks INTO a merged branch's own history and
# picks up a side commit's pre-merge authorship time, not when it actually
# landed on MAIN_REF; T47 reproduces the false-fire/false-n/a this caused).
# A slice lands via a merge commit in this repo's trains workflow (D25), so
# the merge commit itself IS the slice's landing event here, not a wrapper
# to skip. Docs-only commits (touching only docs/, *.md, .gitleaksignore)
# never count -- a docs commit sitting on main is not backlog pressure for
# a release. Changed paths are read via `git diff --name-only <sha>^1
# <sha>` (first-parent diff) rather than `git show --name-only`: for a
# merge commit, `git show` prints a combined diff that comes back EMPTY for
# a clean merge, which would silently misclassify a real (non-docs) slice
# merge -- see T47b. `^1` diff works identically for an ordinary
# non-merge commit (its only parent). Reuses `unreleased["tag"]` /
# `_npm_tag_mismatch` (same "newest v* tag whose version equals npm's
# latest dist-tag" definition, same npm lookup, no second network call)
# and `ci_status` (same main-CI result, with its own Tests-run-list

# That means a "proven" count inferred purely from "zero pending ids for Pn"
# can only ever stay flat or INCREASE from an older ref to a newer one -- it
# is structurally unable to register a real regression, even while
# tests/moat/run.sh itself reports a live FAIL with an unlisted
# "REGRESSION: ... FAIL but not listed in tests/moat/pending.txt" line (a
# property can have zero pending.txt lines at BOTH the baseline tag and HEAD
# while its suite fails live in between -- verified on this repo: pulse's old
# pending-only heuristic read "3 of 9 proven" while `bash tests/moat/run.sh`
# reported "2 of 9 proven, FAIL (3 rule failures)" for the identical commit,
# because P7 has no pending.txt line at either ref).
#
# So MOAT_REGRESSION below never uses the pending-derived count as its source
# of truth -- only PULSE_MOAT_RESULT, which must point to a file holding the
# real captured stdout of a `tests/moat/run.sh` run (its own summary lines are
# parsed verbatim: "moat: N of 9 properties proven" and, when the suite
# failed, "moat suite: FAIL (K rule failure(s))"). Typical use (SHA captured

#   PULSE_MOAT_RESULT=/path/to/moat-result.txt bash scripts/v10-pulse.sh
# Re-running the suite inside this script's own ~9s budget is not an option
# (the suite alone takes minutes), so when no result file is supplied, or it
# cannot be read, or its summary lines cannot be parsed, MOAT_REGRESSION is
# reported UNKNOWN rather than silently falling back to the pending-derived
