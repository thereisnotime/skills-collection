# Loki Mode Event Emitter - Bash helper for emitting events
#
# Usage:
#   ./emit.sh <type> <source> <action> [key=value ...]
#
# Examples:
#   ./emit.sh session cli start provider=claude
#   ./emit.sh task runner complete task_id=task-001
#   ./emit.sh error hook failed error="Command blocked"
#
# Environment:
#   LOKI_DIR - Path to .loki directory (default: .loki)
#
# Sourcing:
#   This script can also be sourced (LOKI_EMIT_LIB_ONLY=1) to expose the
#   safe_append_event_jsonl() helper without performing an emit.

# safe_append_event_jsonl <events_jsonl_path> <line>
#
# Cross-process serialized append to .loki/events.jsonl. POSIX append is
# atomic only for writes <PIPE_BUF (typically 4KB) and not all filesystems
# honor it; under parallel-worktree contention bare `>>` can interleave
# partial JSONL lines. This helper serializes appends across processes.
#
# Strategy (v7.5.10):
#   - Prefer flock(1) when available (Linux, util-linux). Uses an
#     exclusive lock on a sentinel FD bound to <events>.lock so the lock
#     is released automatically when the subshell exits.
#   - Fall back to a mkdir() mutex on macOS / BSDs where flock is not
#     installed by default. mkdir is atomic on POSIX -- exactly one
#     concurrent caller wins the create. We retry with backoff up to
#     ~5s, and treat a stale lockdir (>30s old) as abandonable.
#   - The newline is appended by the helper -- callers pass the JSON
#     payload only.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SELF-REAPER: telemetry must never outlive the thing it observes.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY A WATCHDOG AND NOT ANOTHER LOCK FIX. v8.1.0 fixed a specific unbounded
# wait (bare `flock -x`, and a staleness check that ran only after 500 attempts).
# It was a real fix and it was not sufficient: MEASURED 2026-07-30, AFTER that
# release, 63 orphaned emit.sh processes were alive on this machine, the oldest
# 10h51m, each burning ~5% CPU, contributing to load 63 on 14 cores. Every one
# of them started AFTER the fix landed, so whatever wedges emit.sh is not (only)
# the path that was fixed.
#
# The lesson is that patching each discovered hang is an arms race we keep
# losing, because a hang anywhere in this script has the same user-visible cost.
# emit.sh is FIRE-AND-FORGET telemetry: nothing waits on its result, and a
# dropped event is strictly cheaper than a wedged process. So instead of proving
# no path can block, we cap the lifetime of EVERY path.
#
# A background timer SIGKILLs this process after LOKI_EMIT_MAX_SECONDS (default
# 10). It is deliberately blunt: no cleanup hook, no graceful drain, because the
# failure mode being defended against is precisely "graceful paths did not run".
# The killer is disowned so it never becomes a job the parent shell waits on,
# and it exits immediately when the main process finishes normally.
#
# Set LOKI_EMIT_MAX_SECONDS=0 to disable (useful only when debugging emit.sh
# itself -- an operator who disables it is choosing the orphan risk knowingly).

# JSON escape helper: handles \, ", and control characters including newlines
#
# The sed pass escapes backslash, double-quote, tab and carriage-return to
# their named short forms (\\ \" \t \r); the first awk pass collapses embedded
# newlines to \n. Every REMAINING C0 control byte (0x01-0x08, 0x0B-0x0C,
# 0x0E-0x1F -- which includes backspace 0x08 and form-feed 0x0C) is invalid raw
# inside a JSON string and is escaped as \uXXXX by the final awk pass (its map
# covers all of i=1..31). Without that escaping json.loads / JSON.parse reject
# the line and consumers (dashboard _read_events, learning aggregator) silently
# drop it. The named short forms emitted by sed are already two-char ASCII by
# the time the final pass runs, so they are never re-escaped.
#
# NOTE: backspace/form-feed are deliberately NOT escaped in the sed pass.
# Doing so requires embedding the raw control bytes in the sed pattern, which
# editors silently strip -- that left the two empty-pattern sed no-ops this
# helper previously carried. An empty sed regex reuses the LAST applied regex,
# so those entries were dead AND a latent corruption hazard. The final awk
# pass already escapes every byte in i=1..31 (backspace and form-feed included)
# to the six-char uXXXX unicode escape, producing valid JSON, so the
# named-short-form variants are unnecessary.
