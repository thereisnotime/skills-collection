"""equivalence_report.py -- aggregate model x config matrix results into a
per-axis equivalence verdict for the model-equivalence experiment.

Reads the tagged cell result JSONs written by matrix.sh (each row carries a
"cell" field of the form "<model>-<config>", e.g. "haiku-full"; matrix.sh also
set LOKI_BENCH_CELL per cell and runner.py persists it into the row). Computes,
PER AXIS and PER (model,config) cell:

  correctness = success_rate (deterministic held-out acceptance exit 0)
  honesty     = fraction of trials with a real proof present, else not_captured
  design      = not_captured (D-val judge is Planned, not built)

For each cell: the point estimate + a Wilson score interval for the binomial
success_rate. The hero comparison is gap = success_rate(haiku-full) minus
success_rate(opus-baseline), with a bootstrap CI (>=2000 resamples over
(task,trial) pairs, fixed seed for reproducibility).

Decision line per axis: "equivalent within epsilon" / "real residual gap"
/ "UNDERPOWERED at N=k, need N>=m".

HONESTY GUARDS:
  - Never fabricate a cell that did not run (shows not_run).
  - Always print N and spread.
  - REFUSES to compare two runs (haiku-full vs opus-baseline) for the SAME task
    when their task_hash differs (never compare across a changed corpus).
  - Small N cannot prove equivalence; the decision line says so explicitly.

Outputs a human-readable table (stdout / RESULTS-EQUIVALENCE.md) and a machine
JSON. Reuses report._median.

No emojis. No em dashes.
