"""Shared helpers for R2 benchmark adapters.

Responsibilities:
  - Robustly make autonomy/lib/efficiency_cost.py importable from anywhere in
    the tree (the adapters live under benchmarks/bench/adapters/, the cost
    module lives under autonomy/lib/). Import is done lazily / defensively so
    that importing an adapter never requires the cost module to load and never
    requires live API keys.
  - Build the canonical adapter-output dict so that NO adapter can accidentally
    emit a success or quality field. The schema is constructed here and the
    builder hard-strips success/quality if a caller ever passes them.

Per the spec (benchmarks/SCHEMA-adapter.md / R2 plan), adapter output is:
  {tool, tool_version, model_used, duration_s, iterations,
   tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd|null, exit_status, provenance}

provenance is a dict: {kind, verified, ...}. kind is one of
  "automated" (the adapter ran the tool itself) or
  "manual" (operator-supplied numbers, verified=false).
