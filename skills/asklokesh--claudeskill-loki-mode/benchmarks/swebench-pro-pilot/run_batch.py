# Stage 2 measured ~$14.55/instance at LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS=8 (vs $3-8 expected)
# and found the in-product USD breaker inert (cost pipeline defect). To stay
# inside the authorized $30-80 envelope: instances 2-10 run at
# LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS=4 and the batch hard-aborts when cumulative measured
# spend reaches USD 78. Instances not run are reported explicitly as
# "not run (budget exhausted)" -- never silently dropped. Instance 1 ran
# pre-amendment at max_iter=8 and is documented as such.
#
# Full-119 run (2026-06-10): same host-side cumulative breaker mechanism as the
# Section 11 amendment, cap raised to the founder-authorized full-run envelope
# of USD 700 (smoke calibration projected ~$608-629 generation cost for 119 at
# max_iter=4; $700 hard cap, $952 worst case). max_iter stays 4. This is a
# pre-registered operational parameter consistent with Section 11's mechanism;
# only the numeric cap changed. The 10 smoke records in batch_records.json are
# retained and skipped by the resume loop; their $62.16 counts toward the cap.
