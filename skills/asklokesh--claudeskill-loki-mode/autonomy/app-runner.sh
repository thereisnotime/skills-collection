# App Runner Module (v5.45.0)
#
# Detects, starts, restarts, and monitors user applications during autonomous
# Loki Mode sessions. Auto-restarts on code changes, provides health checks,
# and integrates with the dashboard and completion council.
#
# Functions:
#   app_runner_init()            - Detect app type and prerequisites
#   app_runner_start()           - Start the detected application
#   app_runner_stop()            - Stop the running application
#   app_runner_restart()         - Restart (stop + start)
#   app_runner_health_check()    - Check if app is healthy (HTTP or PID)
#   app_runner_should_restart()  - Check if code changes warrant restart
#   app_runner_cleanup()         - Full cleanup on session exit
#   app_runner_status()          - One-line status for prompt injection
#   app_runner_watchdog()        - Auto-restart on crash (with circuit breaker)
#
# Environment Variables:
#   LOKI_APP_RUNNER              - Enable/disable (default: true)
#   LOKI_APP_RUNNER_ENABLED      - Alias for LOKI_APP_RUNNER
#   LOKI_APP_PORT                - Override detected port
#   LOKI_APP_COMMAND             - Override app start command
#
# Data:
#   .loki/app-runner/state.json       - App state
#   .loki/app-runner/app.pid          - Process ID
#   .loki/app-runner/app.log          - Application stdout/stderr
#   .loki/app-runner/health.json      - Last health check

# L5 fix (PID-file reuse race): capture a disambiguating identity token for a
# live PID, so a later liveness check can tell "our app is still running" apart
# from "the OS reassigned the crashed app's PID to an unrelated process". A raw
# `kill -0 $pid` cannot make that distinction: a reused PID reports a foreign
# process as a healthy app.
#
# Token = the process start time (`lstart`) plus its command name (`comm`), one
# line, read from `ps`. `lstart` is the strong disambiguator: it is constant for
# a process lifetime and a reused PID is, by definition, a different (later)
# process with a different start time. `comm` is a weaker secondary signal kept
# for human readability. We compare the whole line by plain string equality.
#
# Portability: the `ps -o lstart=,comm=` field set works on both BSD (macOS) and
# GNU/Linux. We never parse the format -- we only ever compare two reads taken on
# the SAME host (capture at start vs read at check), so the BSD-vs-Linux format
# difference is irrelevant: the two strings either match or they do not. Returns
# empty on any `ps` miss (dead/foreign pid) so callers can fall back safely.

# Signal an EXPLICIT, pre-captured set of PIDs with a given signal.
#
# Usage: _app_runner_signal_pids <SIGNAL> <pid> [pid ...]
#
# Why an explicit list and not "(re-)walk from root": a worker that traps
# SIGTERM (a Node server doing graceful shutdown is the textbook case) survives
# the TERM phase while its intermediate ancestors (npm, sh) die. Once the
# ancestors die, the surviving worker reparents to init, so re-deriving the tree
# from the now-dead root via `pgrep -P` would return NOTHING -- the KILL phase
# would be skipped and the orphaned, port-holding worker would live on. That is
# exactly the orphaned-worker bug (BUG 1) resurfacing at the force-kill phase.
# The fix: the caller snapshots root + all descendants ONCE before any signal,
# and every phase (TERM, aliveness, KILL) operates over that frozen list.
#
# Safety: the caller builds the list from _app_runner_collect_descendants, which
# only ever follows parent->child links from OUR pid, so the list can never
# contain a process outside our own subtree. We signal pids individually (never
# a process group) because in the non-setsid path the app inherits the
# orchestrator's process group; a group signal would kill run.sh and the agent.
# Pids are signaled in REVERSE capture order so descendants (captured after the
# root) are signaled before the root.

# `node .next/standalone/server.js`; modern Next standalone resolves its asset
# paths from the server.js __dirname, not cwd, so a TARGET_DIR-relative launch is
# correct without an extra chdir. The `output: 'standalone'` next.config grep is

# Probe app-scoped candidate ports for a live HTTP listener and echo the first
# port that actually responds, nothing if none do. This handles the case where
# the app sits behind a reverse proxy or otherwise binds a port we did not
# choose: rather than fabricate a URL for a port nothing is listening on, we
# verify liveness with a real HTTP probe before surfacing anything.
#
# Conservatism, in order of importance:
#   - Candidates are APP-SCOPED only (PORT env, the recorded port, and the
#     framework default passed by the caller). We deliberately do NOT blind-scan
#     well-known ports like 80/443/8080, because some unrelated local service
#     answering there is its own form of fabrication.
#   - Liveness uses the same contract as _app_runner_reconcile_port (curl -s
#     -o /dev/null -m 2, no -f): any HTTP response (incl. 404/401/500) proves a
#     server is bound; a connection error (dead/unbound port) is a non-zero exit.
#   - curl-less hosts cannot verify, so we surface NOTHING (we never guess a URL
#     we could not probe). This is the conservative direction for this helper:
#     its whole job is "probe before surfacing", so no curl == no claim.
# Args: $1 = framework default port (may be empty). Reads $LOKI_APP_PORT and
# $_APP_RUNNER_PORT from the environment as additional candidates.

    # app_runner_health_check (HTTP-aware for apps that declared a port), and
    # treat an unhealthy-but-alive process as a crash so the same circuit
    # breaker + backoff + restart path handles it.
    # L5 fix: gate on BOTH liveness AND identity. If kill -0 succeeds but the
    # PID is a foreign process the OS reassigned our crashed app's PID to
    # (_app_runner_pid_is_ours false), we must NOT enter this branch: the
    # alive-but-unhealthy path below calls app_runner_stop, which would send
    # TERM/KILL to an innocent stranger. Instead let a reused PID fall through to
    # the dead path, which only increments the crash count and restarts -- it
    # never signals the PID. (No token captured -> is_ours returns true ->
    # behaves exactly as before, so no regression for legitimately-running apps.)
