# autonomy/spec-interrogation.sh - P2-1 spec interrogation + P2-2 assumption ledger.
#
# Net-new spec-robustness capability. Loki stays accurate even when the input
# spec is WRONG, ambiguous, or incomplete by DETECTING spec defects in the
# DISCOVERY phase and SURFACING them as first-class RECORDED ASSUMPTIONS, never
# silently autocorrecting.
#
# It reuses two existing building blocks unchanged:
#   - autonomy/grill.sh         the Devil's-Advocate spec interrogation (provider
#                               subcall) that writes .loki/grill/report.md.
#   - autonomy/prd-analyzer.py  deterministic missing-dimension detection that
#                               already generates assumption text (_make_assumption).
#
# This module:
#   1. classifies grill's report.md into structured findings
#      (ambiguous / contradictory / underspecified / missing) with a
#      deterministic severity (high / medium) -- NO LLM, reproducible.
#   2. records each spec gap as a first-class ledger entry under .loki/assumptions/.
#   3. exposes spec_ledger_high_unresolved_count for the completion gate
#      (council_assumption_ledger_gate in completion-council.sh).
#
# Design note (auto-acknowledgment lifecycle):
#   The completion gate blocks iff an entry is severity=high AND confirmed=false
#   AND acknowledged=false. In autonomous (non-TTY) mode no human can ever set
#   confirmed=yes, so the auto-acknowledgment lifecycle (run.sh) marks an
#   assumption acknowledged once it has been injected into the build prompt at
#   least once. That is the OPPOSITE of silent autocorrect: the gap is recorded,
#   prompt-injected, and surfaced in proof-of-done. LOKI_ASSUMPTIONS_REQUIRE_CONFIRM=1
#   disables auto-ack for a human-in-the-loop path (only confirmed=true clears).
#
# Design note (P2-4 contradictions -- the exception to the lifecycle above):
#   A GAP can become a recorded assumption: "the spec is silent, so I took the
#   implementer default." A CONTRADICTION cannot -- there is no default that
#   satisfies "X and not-X". So a contradiction (class=contradictory, forced to
#   severity=high) is NEVER auto-acknowledged, even in default autonomous mode
#   (spec_ledger_acknowledge_all skips it). It stays acknowledged=false and keeps
#   the completion gate BLOCKED until a human sets confirmed=true. We chose this
#   "block, do not assume away" behavior over the softer "auto-ack but surface
#   loudly" option because a silently-acked contradiction lets "done" be declared
#   over a spec we know is internally inconsistent, which is exactly the
#   accuracy failure this feature exists to prevent. Honest cost: in a fully
#   autonomous run an unresolved contradiction grinds the loop to max-iterations
#   (no human to confirm), wasting budget. It is STILL surfaced in proof-of-done
#   on every terminal path. Escape hatches: a human sets confirmed=true in
#   .loki/assumptions/, or the operator sets LOKI_ASSUMPTION_GATE=0. A follow-up
#   in run.sh (out of this module's scope) should add an early hard-stop on an
#   unresolved contradiction so the run fails fast instead of grinding.
#   Contradictions come from two sources: spec-INTERNAL (grill finds them, the
#   classifier tags them) and spec-EXTERNAL (spec_interrogation_external_check
#   compares the spec to the repo's declared dependencies; narrow + high-
#   confidence by design).
#
# Provider-aware + clean degrade: grill needs a provider CLI; when absent we log
# an honest message, skip the grill subcall (NO fabricated questions), but STILL
# fold prd-analyzer's deterministic missing-dimension assumptions into the ledger
# as medium (non-blocking) so degrade still surfaces something.
#
# Opt-out knobs (all default-on):
#   LOKI_SPEC_GRILL=0                  skip interrogation entirely
#   LOKI_ASSUMPTION_GATE=0            completion gate is pass-through (gate file)
#   LOKI_ASSUMPTIONS_REQUIRE_CONFIRM=1  require human confirmed=true (no auto-ack)
#   LOKI_SPEC_EXTERNAL_CHECK=0       skip the spec-vs-repo external contradiction check

# P2-4 EXTERNAL contradiction check: spec vs existing code/config.
#
# A spec-internal contradiction is found by the grill (LLM) and recognized by
# the classifier above. An EXTERNAL contradiction is the spec disagreeing with
# the repo it is being built into (spec says Postgres, repo wired to Mongo).
#
# Design constraint -- PRECISION OVER RECALL (deliberate):
#   A contradiction is tagged high + contradictory and (per the auto-ack skip
#   above) BLOCKS completion until a human resolves it. In an autonomous run no
#   human is present, so a false positive grinds a GOOD spec to max-iterations.
#   That is a severe failure mode. A grep heuristic is far lower-confidence than
#   the LLM-identified internal contradictions feeding the same blocking path, so
#   this check fires ONLY on UNAMBIGUOUS POSITIVE-CONFLICT evidence and is happy
#   to miss real conflicts (low recall) rather than ever block a clean spec.
#
# Scope of THIS slice: database-engine conflict only -- the single signal where
# "what the spec names" and "what the repo is wired to" are both concretely
# detectable from declared dependencies. The trigger requires ALL FOUR:
#   1. the spec explicitly names database engine X, AND
#   2. a manifest (package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod / pyproject.toml /
#      Gemfile) declares a concrete driver for a DIFFERENT engine Y, AND
#   3. that same manifest declares NO driver for engine X, AND
#   4. the spec does NOT also name engine Y (if it names BOTH, the spec is
#      discussing the choice -- "we chose Mongo over Postgres" -- not in
#      conflict; skip rather than false-fire on a good spec).
# Bare prose substring matches in source files are intentionally NOT used (specs
# mention databases in passing; comments and migrations carry both drivers).
#
# Honest deferral: other external conflicts (REST-vs-gRPC, language/runtime,
# cloud provider) are NOT implemented here. They need a higher-confidence
# extractor than a single grep and are documented as the harder follow-up.
#
# Usage: spec_interrogation_external_check <spec_path>
