"""Deterministic re-verifier for Loki Mode proof-of-run receipts.

Companion to proof-generator.py. The generator writes proof.json with an
integrity hash so a skeptic can prove the JSON bytes were not edited since
they were hashed. This module goes further: it re-checks the receipt's
recorded FACTS against the live repo, so a skeptic can prove the recorded
diff STILL matches what is in git, not merely that the JSON bytes are
unaltered. It also re-derives the honesty headline from the recorded facts
(see headline_consistent below) to catch an INCONSISTENT edit -- a proof
whose headline was flipped to VERIFIED while the facts still say not_run.

What this does NOT do -- honest scope. On the UNSIGNED path (no valid gpg
signature) the generator is TRUSTED: the recorded facts are taken at face
value. A forger who rewrites BOTH the facts AND the headline to a mutually
consistent lie, then recomputes the integrity hash, still passes every
check here -- the hash proves only bytes-unedited-since-hashing, and the
re-derived diff can be made to match a repo the forger controls. Neutral,
adversarial non-forgeability (the generator is NOT trusted) requires the
SIGNED record: a detached gpg signature from a key the verifier trusts.
When gpg_ok is True the generator is not trusted; when gpg_ok is "n/a" it
is. This module reports that distinction (generator_trusted) rather than
overclaiming that re-checking the diff makes a receipt non-forgeable. It
does not.

Three checks (mirrors dashboard/audit.py verify-CLI style):

  1. TAMPER CHECK (hash_ok): strip verification.hash, re-canonicalize exactly
     as the generator does (sort_keys=True, compact separators, the same
     ensure_ascii setting), sha256, compare to the recorded verification.hash.
     Any mismatch means the JSON was edited after signing.

  2. DRIFT CHECK (diff_drift): from the recorded git base sha, re-derive the
     final committed, staged, unstaged, deleted, and untracked workspace diff.
     Compare its stat and diff_sha256 to the receipt. When tree_sha256 is
     present, also bind exact final file content so equal line counts cannot
     hide content drift.

  3. GPG (gpg_ok): if a detached signature is present and gpg is available,
     verify it over the canonical bytes. Otherwise "n/a".

Honesty rules (CLAUDE.md binding):
  - Never claim "verified" when a check could not run. If the base ref is
    missing or unresolvable, diff_drift is reported as None and `ok` is False
    with a reason; we never silently pass an undrifted-but-unchecked receipt.
  - Surface honesty.degraded from the proof so the verifier output also shows
    the gaps the generator already disclosed.
  - set -u / robust: missing file, malformed JSON, missing fields produce a
    clear error and exit 2, never a traceback-as-UX.

Schema compatibility:
  - Generator schema v1.0 records the diff under top-level files_changed{} and
    diffs[], with NO recorded base sha, so drift cannot be re-derived (the
    verifier says so honestly rather than pretending).
  - Schema v1.1 (if/when the generator slice lands it) records
    facts.git.{base_sha, head_sha, diff, diff_sha256}. This verifier prefers
    facts.git when present and falls back to the v1.0 layout otherwise.

CLI:
    python3 autonomy/lib/proof-verify.py <proof.json> [repo_dir]
  Prints the JSON result. Exit 0 if ok, 1 on tamper / drift / bad signature,
  2 on a usage / load error (missing file, malformed JSON).
