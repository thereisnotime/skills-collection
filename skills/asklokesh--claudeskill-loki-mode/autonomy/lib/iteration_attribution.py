"""Explain WHY a run took the iterations it took.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Iterations are the direct multiplier on both wall clock and
cost, and the Evidence Receipt reports only `{count, succeeded, failed}`. A user
who sees "6 iterations" cannot tell real work from a gate false-positive that
forced five redos. Neither can we, which is worse: it means we cannot tell
whether an expensive run was the model being slow or the harness being wrong.

That distinction has already bitten this project. A measured run had the agent
claim done on EVERY iteration while a mock-integrity false positive blocked all
six, and a start-sha bug made the council see a permanently empty diff so it
could never vote done. Both were HARNESS defects billed to the user as model
cost. Removing a false positive raises accuracy AND cuts iterations, which is
the rare change that improves both axes at once -- but only if you can see it.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not guess. Every field is derived from records
the engine already writes, and anything not recorded is reported as unknown
rather than inferred. An attribution that invents a reason would be worse than
no attribution, because it would send someone optimising the wrong thing.

Sources, all already written by the engine:
  .loki/metrics/efficiency/iteration-N.json   status, duration_ms, cost_usd, model
  .loki/events.jsonl                          iteration_complete events

    The definition is deliberately conservative and stated plainly, because a

      rework    an iteration that FAILED and therefore had to be repeated

    This is a floor on rework, not a ceiling. An iteration that "completed" but
    was forced to run again by a false-positive gate is counted as progress here,
    because the engine does not currently record the blocking gate per iteration.
    Saying so is the point: the number is honest about what it cannot see.
