# on bash builtins + npm/claude on PATH. It defines its own colors and never
# reads $RED/$NC or any other variable owned by autonomy/loki, because when
# doctor.ts spawns it standalone those variables are unset. If this file ever
# starts depending on loki's environment, the bash-route and Bun-route bytes
# diverge and the bun-parity matrix breaks.
#
# Security posture (design 1.7): the ONLY command ever executed on the user's
# behalf is `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, only after explicit
# consent, with the exact command printed first. No sudo. No curl-pipe-bash.
# Non-interactive / CI contexts never run an install.

#
# FAIL CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. A green doctor followed by a failed first build is
# worse than today's honest blocker, so all THREE conditions must hold:
#
#   1. USABLE, not merely declared. @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk is an
#      optionalDependency whose own per-platform binary is itself an
#      optionalDependency, so `--no-optional`, an offline install, or an
#      unsupported platform all leave the package listed in package.json (or even
#      sdk.mjs on disk) with NO runnable executable. We therefore probe for the
#      extracted binary at @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<platform>/claude, not
#      for the JS entrypoint. Glob over the platform suffix instead of mapping
#      uname, so a new platform tuple needs no edit here.
#   2. CREDENTIALS present. The SDK is pure HTTPS: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, an
#      ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN, or an ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL gateway. Absent all three,
#      the loop would stall exactly like a logged-out CLI.
#   3. THE SDK LOOP IS ACTIVE. This is the condition that is easy to miss: with
#      the SDK installed and a key set but LOKI_SDK_MODE unset, `loki start`
#      never forks to Bun (bin/loki:255 tests LOKI_SDK_LOOP) and dies on the bash
#      route at loki:1940. We read LOKI_SDK_LOOP because autonomy/lib/sdk-mode.sh
#      has already resolved LOKI_SDK_MODE=full into it at bin/loki:41-46, which
#      runs for every subcommand. Reading the resolved flag (not the mode string)
#      also honors an explicit per-site LOKI_SDK_LOOP=1.
#
# Any doubt -> return 1 and the caller keeps today's behavior verbatim.
