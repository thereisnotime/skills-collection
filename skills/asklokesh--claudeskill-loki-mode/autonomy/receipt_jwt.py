"""Per-job receipt attestation: a signed JWT plus a public JWKS.

WHY THIS EXISTS, given old receipts could carry a gpg signature.

A gpg signature proves a receipt was produced by a holder of that gpg key,
and for a LOCAL build that is the whole story: the operator already has the
keyring. It does not survive the remote path. A submitter who ran
`loki start --remote https://loki.corp` never had local access to the cluster,
so "fetch our public key out of band and import it into gpg" is the step where
independent verification actually stops happening.

JWKS closes exactly that gap and nothing else: the verifier fetches
`/.well-known/jwks.json` over the same TLS connection it already trusts for the
API, and checks the signature with a stdlib-shaped algorithm. The receipt gains
per-job identity binding gpg never carried -- job id, submitter and issue time
as SIGNED claims, not prose in the body.

TWO DESIGN CONSTRAINTS, both decided by code that already exists rather than by
preference.

1. THE RECEIVER SIGNS. NEVER THE WORKER. The worker executes model-directed
   code and already holds ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN
   (helm/loki-mode/templates/worker-deployment.yaml). A signing key there would
   let a build sign its own receipt, and a self-attested receipt attests to
   nothing. The private key lives only in the receiver Deployment, matching the
   rule stated at the top of templates/secret.yaml.

2. `kid` AND A MULTI-KEY JWKS FROM DAY ONE. This is the half-built failure the
   whole item was deferred over. With a single unlabeled key, the first rotation
   makes every previously-issued receipt fail verification -- and a receipt that
   fails verification is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a tampered one. That collapses
   TAMPERED into UNCHECKED and destroys the four-verdict separation the trust
   core is built on. So JWKS serves current AND retired keys, and every token
   carries the `kid` that signed it.

Ed25519 (EdDSA), not RSA: fixed-size keys, no parameter choices to get wrong,
and `cryptography` is already a dependency. Signing is OPTIONAL and fail-open
in the sense that matters -- no key configured means no `attestation` field and
the receipt keeps its existing UNSIGNED verdict. It never means an unsigned
receipt is presented as signed.
