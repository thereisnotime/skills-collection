// -- so every stage prompt shares a byte-identical leading block and the
// provider's prompt cache hits. Per-task content is the caller's own prompt,
// appended after this block by the SDK, never here.
// Data only: this file is a string, no imports, no
// verdict logic, nothing engine10/stages/ needs to import back.
