// v7.5.3: hidden internal Bun command that bash autonomy/run.sh calls
// once per iteration to drive the Phase 1 hooks (findings + learnings +
// override council + handoff doc) without paying a fork cost per gate.
//
// Why hidden: this is NOT a user-facing command. It exists so the bash
// runner can reuse the Bun side's structured-findings parser, override
// council judges, learnings writer, and handoff doc renderer instead of
// reimplementing all of them in bash. Per the "embedded by default" UX
// mandate, users never invoke this directly -- they just run `loki start`
// and the bash runner orchestrates it.
//
// Subcommands (designed for one-shot bash invocation):
//   loki internal phase1-hooks reflect <iter>
//      Read .loki/quality/reviews/<latest> -> write .loki/state/findings-<iter>.json
//      Append learnings for each blocking finding (LOKI_AUTO_LEARNINGS).
//
//   loki internal phase1-hooks override <iter>
//      Read counter-evidence-<iter>.json (if present) -> run override
//      council. Print "lifted" or "blocked" to stdout. Write transcript
//      to .loki/quality/reviews/<latest>/override-<iter>.json.
//
//   loki internal phase1-hooks handoff <gate-name> <consecutive-failures> <iter>
//      Write the structured handoff doc before bash writes .loki/PAUSE.

// WAVE13 trust fix -- the agent-authored stub route fails CLOSED.
//
// Root cause: this bash-route override hook (loki internal phase1-hooks
// override) ran a synchronous "stub judge" that could lift a Critical/High
// code_review BLOCK on counter-evidence the GATED AGENT WROTE ITSELF.
// escalation_handoff used to tell the agent: "Write
// .loki/state/counter-evidence-<iter>.json". The same actor that disputes a
// finding also supplies the "proof", so every mechanically-checkable proofType
// is forgeable by construction: file-exists -> touch any file; grep-miss ->
// write an empty file; test-passes -> write "0 failed". Mechanical verification
// of self-authored artifacts is not verification, and an earlier WAVE13 attempt
// that "verified each artifact on disk" did NOT close the hole -- the same
// party controls the disk. A trust gate the gated party can bypass is not a
// gate.
//
// Fix: on this agent-authored stub route the stub judge auto-approves NOTHING.
// Every counter-evidence record returns REJECT_OVERRIDE, so a Critical/High
// code_review BLOCK is never lifted by self-certification. The legitimate ways
// forward are (a) fix the finding, or (b) the human-escape path -- the operator
// reviews and resumes via `rm .loki/PAUSE` (optionally directing the agent with
// `.loki/HUMAN_INPUT.md`), both confirmed in autonomy/run.sh.
//
// The only adjudicated override that may legitimately lift a BLOCK is the
// Bun-route real-LLM judge (quality_gates.ts maybeRunOverrideCouncil), which
// uses an adjudicator the agent does not control; that path is unchanged here.
// counter-evidence on this bash route is still recorded for audit (transcript
// written below) but never self-lifts.
//
// The stub stays synchronous (no grep subprocess, no test runner, no network)
// to preserve the no-hung-provider property of the bash-driven loop, and the
// collision-guard in runOverrideCouncil is preserved.
