// loki-ts/src/engine10/modernize/presealed_wall.ts -- M-14: Wall pre-sealed mode (MODERNIZE.md
// section 7 "Target conformance", D30). Runs the target-conformance check against the BASE tree,
// before any new implementation exists, and seals only a genuinely red run.
//
// "The captured oracle passes on the OLD code by construction. The Wall therefore also carries a
// check that the old code fails" (section 7): the conformance check must fail (red) on base,
// under the TARGET runtime, since the unit has not been modernized yet. "A Wall that is green
// before any change is a design error reported as oracle.flagged. It is never
// ALREADY_SATISFIED" -- sealPreSealedWall below refuses to seal a green base outright, the same
// as it refuses a not_run one; only a genuinely red base ever gets sealed.
//
// D42 (3)'s red/not_run classification governs here too, duplicated rather than imported from
// stages/wall.ts: S41-16 owns that file this wave (BOARD.md M-14 notes: "Do not touch the core
// wall.ts"), and D33's core line budget stays untouched by this slice either way. red = the
// runner started and reported at least one failed test on its OWN documented failure exit code
// (pytest exit 1; other runners' own documented failure exit -- never "any nonzero exit", which
// would read a crash, an OOM kill or a signal (exit 139, exit 137, or a null exitCode with no
// signal-independent code at all) as red just because a stale failedCount happened to be set,
// r1's B1). A pytest collection error (exit 2) is red only when it is
// ImportError/AttributeError/NameError AND the runner resolved the failing name to an actual
// file inside the repo under test (the feature genuinely does not exist there yet) -- never for
// an unresolvable third-party package, which is an environment problem, not evidence of
// anything (r1's B2: a plain ModuleNotFoundError is an ImportError too, and reports the same
// way). Exit 126/127, tool not found, pytest exit 3, 4 or 5, a timeout, a null exitCode, or no
// parsed finite integer failed count is not_run, which refuses the seal (NOT PROVEN) and never
// counts as red.
//
// Bound to the oracle (r1's B4): a unit whose M-12 oracle seal is missing or invalid has nothing
// this check could ever prove equivalent to, so sealPreSealedWall calls oracle/seal.ts's
// verifySeal before running anything, and carries the oracle's cases_sha256, coverage_sha256 and
// normalizers_sha256 into the Wall seal and its event -- a later equivalence check (M-13's
// equiv.ts) can tell which exact oracle capture this presealed run was run against.
//
// Tamper-evident the same way M-12's seal.ts is (r1's B3): the sealed file's own sha256 goes
// into the wall.presealed.sealed event, which is append-only and outside the file a
// delete-and-rewrite attack targets (see oracle/seal.ts's file header for the full argument);
// verifyPreSealedWall recomputes the on-disk hash and compares it to the event's, so rewriting
// presealed_wall.json (target, failed_count, anything) after the fact is caught even though the
// rewritten file is otherwise well-formed JSON.
