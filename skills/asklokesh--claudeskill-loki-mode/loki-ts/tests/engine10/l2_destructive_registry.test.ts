// select: walk-all-src
// ENGINE-LAWS L2 enforcement: every git call under loki-ts/src that can discard, rewrite or move user work (checkout, restore,
// reset, clean, rm as an argv element) must be listed here with a class and a one-line reason. A new call, or a second call
// of the same verb in a listed file, fails until it is classified. Class "work" paths may not hold destructive authority (L2),
// so any entry classed "work" is itself a failure: reclassify it as trust with a real justification, or remove the call.
// To classify a new call, add or bump its entry; do not loosen the scan.
