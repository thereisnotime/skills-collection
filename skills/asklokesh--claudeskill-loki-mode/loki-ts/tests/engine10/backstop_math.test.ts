// 30, and still landed at or before the worker's own soft cap for every capS <= ~750. Follow-up 2: the
// soft cap itself (machine.ts) is now tightened for a small capS so the commit+seal tail actually fits
// before the backstop, everywhere that is achievable at all (default and deep caps are unchanged).
