// The orchestrator's magic_debate toggle must agree with the gate body about
// whether the gate is on. readToggles() decides whether the gate is INVOKED and
// recorded as enabled (quality_gates.ts:3005-3010); runMagicDebateGate's body
// short-circuits to pass unless LOKI_GATE_MAGIC_DEBATE is exactly "true"
// (quality_gates.ts:2520, opt-in default-off per the Phase 5 spec).
//
// Those two predicates were written independently and disagreed. The toggle used
// the shared flag() helper, which returns its fallback when the var is unset or
// empty and treats "1" as true -- so on unset, "" and "1" the orchestrator
// recorded magic_debate as an ENABLED gate while the gate itself self-skipped.
// A receipt then names a gate that never ran, which is the exact class of claim
// this repo's trust layer exists to prevent.
//
// Measured before the fix (toggle_now vs gate_runs):
//   unset    toggle=true   runs=false   DISAGREE
//   ""       toggle=true   runs=false   DISAGREE
//   "true"   toggle=true   runs=true    agree
//   "1"      toggle=true   runs=false   DISAGREE
//   "false"  toggle=false  runs=false   agree
//
// The assertion compares the TWO REAL PREDICATES against each other rather than
// against a hardcoded expected column, so it stays correct if either side
// legitimately moves later. It reads readToggles directly (not a local copy of
// flag()) -- a re-implemented helper would pass even if the real toggle never
// changed.
