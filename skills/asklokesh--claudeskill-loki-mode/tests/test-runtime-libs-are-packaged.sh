# The Python libs the runtime shells out to must ship in the npm package.
#
# THE CLASS THIS GUARDS. Four releases were spent discovering that the checks
# guarding the SHIPPED PACKAGE were themselves unguarded. Everything works from
# a git checkout, so no in-repo test and no GitHub CI job can see these:
#
#   v8.38.0  four quality-gate detectors were never in files[], so
#            mutation-integrity failed closed on EVERY iteration for EVERY npm
#            user -- first-pass completion was impossible regardless of output
#   v8.63.0  the tarball check passed on "6 or more" matches of 6 patterns that
#            healthily produce 8, tolerating the loss of two required artifacts
#
# `tests/test-detectors-are-packaged.sh` now guards the detectors. Nothing
# guarded the autonomy/lib/*.py helpers, which arrived later and carry the
# receipt verifier and the cost-honesty rule. They ship today only because
# files[] happens to contain a broad "autonomy/" entry -- narrowing that entry
# for any reason would silently drop them, and the failure would surface as a
# receipt that cannot be verified rather than as an error.
#
# THE RULES THIS FOLLOWS (CLAUDE.md, learned the expensive way):
#   1. A check guarding the shipped artifact runs in the FAST tier.
#   2. Assert each required thing INDIVIDUALLY, never a count. A threshold
#      cannot say WHICH artifact vanished.
#   3. Guard against vacuity. A substring search over an EMPTY listing reports
#      nothing missing. `npm pack` writes its listing to STDERR, so `2>&1 >file`
#      captures build chatter instead and makes every assertion pass.
