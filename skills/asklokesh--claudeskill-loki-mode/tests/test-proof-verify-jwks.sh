# A third party can check WHO produced a receipt, offline, without Loki.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The product claim is "a receipt you can check yourself." That
# claim is false if checking requires our API token, our infrastructure, or a
# gpg key import over a side channel. `loki proof verify <id> --jwks <url|file>`
# is the surface that makes it true: hand an auditor proof.json and jwks.json
# and they verify integrity AND provenance on their own machine.
#
# TEST 1 IS THE CAPABILITY. A local jwks.json file, no network. An air-gapped
# reviewer is exactly the person who most needs to verify and would be excluded
# by a network-only design.
#
# TEST 5 IS THE REGRESSION GUARD AND IT IS THE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS. This
# script runs under `set -e` (loki:22) and proof-verify.py exits 1 on drift --
# its NORMAL result. A bare call therefore aborts the command before the
# attestation block runs, and the feature is silently dead while every unit test
# of the underlying function still passes. The bug presents as SILENCE, not an
# error, so it is asserted on directly here.
