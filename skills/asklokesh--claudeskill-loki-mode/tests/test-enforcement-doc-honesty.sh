# THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. autonomy/run.sh:515 states LOKI_ALLOWED_PATHS "Does
# NOT restrict provider-driven agent writes (run.sh never sees them)", and
# check_command_allowed carries "intentionally NOT called by run.sh" with zero
# callers. That honesty never reached the docs: the wiki listed both as
# production security controls and a certification ANSWER KEY marked
# "restricts which directories agents can modify" as the correct exam answer.
#
# WHY MARKER-PRESENCE, NOT PHRASE-ABSENCE. A grep hunting for "restrict" near
# "LOKI_ALLOWED_PATHS" fires on the corrected caveat itself, since every
# correction contains both tokens. This repo has been burned by text guards
# matching their own explanatory text. Asserting a required marker is PRESENT
# is structurally incapable of self-firing.
