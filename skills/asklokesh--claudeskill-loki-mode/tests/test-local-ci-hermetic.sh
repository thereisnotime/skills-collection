# E-94: guards scripts/local-ci.sh's hermetic changed-tests scan
# (_lci_hermetic_scan) -- the red-main class from df7dc134 day:
# tests/test-dep-inventory.sh passed locally because `gh` was authenticated
# on this Mac, then failed on the CI runner, which has neither `gh` nor
# GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN.
#
# Static half: greps local-ci.sh for the scope (real test files only, not
# tests/run-all-tests.sh or a fixture .ts, under tests/ or loki-ts/tests/,
# merge-base diff against origin/main), the stripped-env shape (env -i,
# fresh HOME, a curated bindir listed FIRST on PATH), the serial (not
# background-lane) call site, and the fast-tier keep-list membership.
#
# Live half: awk-extracts the REAL _lci_hermetic_scan function body out of
# scripts/local-ci.sh (same technique as
# tests/test-local-ci-parent-exit-isolation.sh) and executes it -- not a
# mirrored reimplementation -- against disposable fixture repos:
#   1. a new test that calls `gh` directly: passes normally, fails stripped
#      -> the scan must FAIL and name the file. Gated on gh actually being
#      reachable normally and actually being UNREACHABLE under the scan's
#      own stripped PATH, not assumed.
#   2. a hermetic-clean new test: passes both runs.
#   3. the actual pre-E-92 scripts/dep-inventory.py (git show
#      4f7f1487^1:scripts/dep-inventory.py), replayed through a copy of the
#      real test-dep-inventory.sh wrapper -> caught the same way, gated on
#      it actually passing normally in this environment first.
#   4. the REAL, current (post-E-92) tests/test-dep-inventory.sh and
#      scripts/dep-inventory.py from this repo, replayed verbatim -> must
#      pass BOTH runs (the must-not-regress case: if the fixed file itself
#      cannot survive the scan, the scan is broken against the exact
#      incident it exists to guard).
#   5. a test using `mapfile`/`declare -A` (bash4+ only): must pass both
#      runs, proving the scan compares like-for-like bash versions rather
#      than false-flagging a version gap (macOS /bin/bash is 3.2) as a
#      credential dependency.
#   6. a test that shells out to `node` and `timeout` directly: must pass
#      both runs, proving the scan's curated bindir covers the toolchain
#      real in-scope tests actually use, not just bash/bun/python3.
