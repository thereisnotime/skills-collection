# The hand-written persona must actually reach the reviewer prompt.
#
# THE DEFECT: all 41 entries in agents/types.json carry real hand-written
# persona prose ("You are a senior backend engineer specializing in..."). The
# selector SET that persona on the specialist dict, and the reviewers payload
# then copied only name/focus/checks -- so the persona was discarded before any
# prompt was built. The role still reached the reviewer via a SYNTHESIZED checks
# line, so nothing looked broken; what was lost was the authored prose.
#
# WHAT IS LOAD-BEARING, and why this is not just "add a field": the reviewer
# prompt's "Your SOLE focus is" constraint is what keeps a blind reviewer on its
# lane. A persona prepended carelessly could dilute it. These assertions check
# the persona is carried AND that the focus constraint survives AND that a
# specialist with NO persona produces a byte-identical prompt to before.
