# A workflow step that captures RC must be able to reach the code that reads it.
#
# THE DEFECT, observed in CI: post-release smoke failed on both npm and docker
# with no diagnostic. The steps looked correct:
#
#     set -uo pipefail
#     loki doctor --json > /tmp/doctor.json
#     RC=$?
#     if [ "$RC" -ne 0 ]; then echo "FATAL: ..."; exit 1; fi
#
# GitHub runs steps with `bash -e {0}`, so -e is ON regardless of that set line.
# A non-zero exit aborts the step BEFORE `RC=$?` is read, so the handler never
# runs and the job fails with no message about what actually broke. Proven:
#
#     bash    probe.sh -> "REACHED:1"   exit 0
#     bash -e probe.sh -> (no output)   exit 1
#
# The fix is `|| RC=$?` on the command itself. This suite makes the pattern
# unable to come back, because the failure mode is silent: the workflow does not
# report "your handler is unreachable", it just dies.
