# Guards release_restore_debugid_only_dist() in scripts/release.sh (E-72).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. loki-ts/scripts/build.ts hashes cockpit.js/cockpit.js.map
# content into a deterministic "//# debugId=" identity, but that hash still
# shifts across checkouts for bundles whose bytes never depend on VERSION.
# A version-only `release.sh --bump-only` rebuild therefore rewrites
# cockpit.js/cockpit.js.map even though nothing but that identity line
# changed -- pure git churn on every bump. release_restore_debugid_only_dist
# restores a dist file from HEAD when its ONLY diff is the debugId text, and
# leaves alone any file (loki.js) whose content genuinely changed.
#
# This test builds a throwaway temp git repo (no network, no real release)
# with a synthetic loki-ts/dist/, sources release.sh to call the helper
# directly, and checks each case.
