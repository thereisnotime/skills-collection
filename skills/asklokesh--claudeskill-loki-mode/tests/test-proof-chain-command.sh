# The buyer's verification command must have a front door.
#
# THE DEFECT: tools/verify-chain.py runs the whole verification chain and
# reports one verdict. It shipped in package.json files[] and NO loki command
# surfaced it, so the command a buyer runs to check our output without trusting
# us was undiscoverable. Our entire wedge is "a receipt you verify yourself";
# a verifier nobody can invoke does not deliver it.
#
# WHAT IS LOAD-BEARING HERE is the exit contract:
#   0 PASSED   1 FAILED   2 UNAVAILABLE   3 NOTHING
# Collapsing 2 or 3 into 1 would destroy the distinction that makes the verdict
# worth anything. A chain that could NOT be checked is not a chain that failed,
# and zero receipts is not a passing audit. These tests assert the codes
# individually rather than asserting "it exits non-zero on problems", which
# would pass while the distinction was being destroyed.
