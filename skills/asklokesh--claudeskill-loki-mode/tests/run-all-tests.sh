# Per-suite timeout (BACKLOG 143). CI's "Shell tests" shard 2 was repeatedly
# cancelled by the workflow's `cancel-in-progress` concurrency group before it
# could finish, because it was still running tests/test-ci-json-argmax.sh when
# the next push arrived (github.com/.../actions/runs/36304977243 and 3 more,
# 2026-09-27). On the one run that WAS allowed to finish
# (github.com/.../actions/runs/36299762731, shard 2 job 108565132341),
# test-ci-json-argmax.sh alone took 1327s (22m07s); every other suite across
# all 4 shards on that same green run finished in <=191s
# (test-trust-core-tests-detect.sh's real `bun test` mutation probes). The
# suite was added in b842a332 (2026-09-26) and its fixture was resized in
# 5c9d4373 the same day to actually clear Linux CI's measured ~4 MiB ARG_MAX
# (~116K findings there vs ~29K on macOS's ~1 MiB ARG_MAX); no shard-2-only
# timing from before either commit was captured, so this cannot pin the
# runtime on one commit over the other -- only that the measured 1327s is real
# and current. Follow-up: shrink the fixture or move the suite out of the
# sharded job. A hang in any OTHER suite now fails LOUD and FAST instead of
# silently consuming the rest of the shard's budget until a human notices and
# cancels the run.

# can export it before invoking tests/run-all-tests.sh directly or via

# SHARDING (S-81, supersedes the plain idx%n split). LOKI_TEST_SHARD=i/n
# splits the suite list across n runners so N runners cut the wall clock by
# roughly N -- but a plain `index % n` split ignores that suites are wildly
# uneven (496 suites from ~0s to 153s measured; see tests/shard-durations.tsv),
# so whichever shard happened to catch the slowest suites set the whole
# workflow's wall clock regardless of n. Measured directly: at n=4 one shard
# held test-ci-json-argmax.sh (1146-1460s alone) while the other three
# finished in 4-8 minutes each.
#
# Fix: assign each suite to a shard by deterministic greedy longest-first
# (LPT) bin-packing over tests/shard-durations.tsv's measured per-suite
# seconds, instead of by index. Suites are sorted longest-first, then each
# goes to whichever shard currently has the smallest running total (ties
# broken by lowest shard number) -- the standard LPT heuristic, computed once
# per invocation from this file's own run_test registration order.
#
# STILL INDEX-BASED FOR REGISTRATION, NOT A CURATED LIST: the packing reads
# every `run_test` call from THIS file in source order (the same grep
# tests/test-shard-coverage.sh uses for its own count) and looks each one up
# by name in the duration table; nothing is hand-maintained per suite. A
# suite missing from the table (new, not yet measured) still gets a shard via
# _shard_default_duration_s below -- it is never silently dropped, and the
# union of all shards is still provably the whole suite list.
#
# The precedent this repo already paid for: a shellcheck "optimization" that
# was ~2x faster and SILENTLY LOST 2 real failures. It was reverted. Speed
# that stops noticing failures is worse than slow. tests/test-shard-coverage.sh
# asserts the shards partition the suite list exactly -- every suite in
# exactly one shard, none dropped, none duplicated -- for every n it checks.
