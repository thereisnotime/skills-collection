# Healing Friction Gate Tests (wave-4)
#
# Targeted regression coverage for two fail-open bugs in the friction safety
# gate of hook_pre_healing_modify (autonomy/hooks/migration-hooks.sh, the inline
# python classification block).
#
#   BUG A (type-coercion fail-open): the old gate computed
#     `safe = friction.get('safe_to_remove', False)` and blocked on `not safe`.
#     A JSON string "false" deserializes to the Python string "false", which is
#     TRUTHY, so `not "false"` == False -> the block was SKIPPED. A business_rule
#     friction the operator declined to remove (safe_to_remove: "false") was
#     therefore ALLOWED. The fix computes `safe = (safe_to_remove is True)`:
#     only a real boolean True clears; the string "false"/"true", int 1, and
#     None are all NOT safe.
#
#   BUG B (blacklist fails open): the old gate blocked only when
#     `cls in ('business_rule', 'unknown')`. The archaeology prompt defines no
#     closed classification taxonomy, so the LLM invents labels freely
#     (workaround, performance_hack, magic_value, ...). Any label OTHER than the
#     two hardcoded ones, with safe_to_remove: false, sailed through. The fix
#     replaces the blacklist with a whitelist: removal is BLOCKED unless the
#     friction is EXPLICITLY marked safe (real boolean True), regardless of
#     classification label.
#
# NON-VACUITY (how these tests FAIL against the OLD buggy behavior):
#   Test A: business_rule + safe_to_remove: "false" (string). Old: the string is
#     truthy, so `not safe` == False, the block is skipped, hook returns 0
#     (ALLOWED). New: `"false" is True` == False -> not safe -> BLOCK (rc 1).
#     This test asserts BLOCK, so the old behavior fails it.
#   Test B: workaround + safe_to_remove: false (real bool). Old: "workaround" is
#     not in ('business_rule','unknown'), so the block is skipped, hook returns 0
#     (ALLOWED). New: not safe -> BLOCK (rc 1) regardless of label. This test
#     asserts BLOCK, so the old behavior fails it.
#   Test C: any friction + safe_to_remove: true (real bool). Both old and new
#     ALLOW (rc 0) -- this is the preserved pass path; unchanged.
#   Test D: heal mode OFF. Both old and new early-return 0 (byte-identical
#     no-op); unchanged.
#
# The test proves A+B by running the CURRENT (fixed) hook and asserting BLOCK,
# and additionally proves the OLD behavior would have passed by re-running the
# same friction-map against a reconstructed OLD gate inline (so the non-vacuity
# is demonstrated live, not just asserted in a comment).
