# `loki doctor` must name its blockers and offer a zero-install next step, on
# BOTH routes, on a host with nothing installed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS -- and it is an adoption bug, not a cosmetic one. The bash
# route ends a failed doctor with the blockers named and:
#
#     Meanwhile 'loki tour' works right now -- no provider, no key, no spend.
#
# The Bun route printed "Some required prerequisites are missing / Install
# missing dependencies and run 'loki doctor' again." That names nothing and
# offers no way forward. A first-time evaluator with no provider CLI -- exactly
# the person deciding whether to keep this tool -- hit a dead end on one route
# and a working demo on the other.
#
# It went unnoticed locally because this machine HAS a provider CLI, so doctor
# passed and the trailer never printed. Only CI, on a bare runner, ran the
# failing path. That is why this test builds a stripped PATH rather than
# trusting the developer's own machine.
#
# The bun-parity workflow compares the two routes' stdout byte for byte, so
# this also guards the gate itself: a reworded trailer on either side fails
# here first, locally, instead of after a push.
