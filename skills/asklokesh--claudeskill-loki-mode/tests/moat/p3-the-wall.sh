# MOAT P3 - The Wall
#
# Property: the agent that writes the code never writes, sees the authoring of,
# or edits the acceptance checks it is graded against.
#
#   P3.implementer-prompt-has-no-check-authoring
#       The implementer's build prompt, produced by the REAL prompt builders on
#       both routes (bash build_prompt in autonomy/run.sh, Bun buildPrompt in
#       loki-ts/src/runner/build_prompt.ts) for a PRD-mode first iteration, must
#       not instruct the implementer to author acceptance checks. Today both
#       emit PRD_CHECKLIST_INIT ("Create .loki/checklist/checklist.json from the
#       PRD ... verification checks ...").
#
#       Two text-based detectors run against the SAME real captured prompt on
#       both routes: the original exact-phrase check (PRD_CHECKLIST_INIT, the
#       "create/write/... .loki/checklist/" verb+path pattern, and the
#       "verification checks (file_exists" schema phrase), plus a second,
#       broader signature detector (verb + "checklist.json" regardless of
#       path phrasing, a literal `"verification": [` JSON array near
#       checklist-authoring context, and the `(file_exists, ...command)`
#       type-enum shape) added under BACKLOG 40, reworked once under S-09 to
#       fix two findings a split quorum review raised.
#
#       The second detector closes a real gap the first one has: it still
#       fires if PRD_CHECKLIST_INIT is renamed and reworded, as long as the
#       replacement text still names checklist.json or the verification
#       schema shape. Its verb/checklist.json gap is character-distance
#       bounded ACROSS THE WHOLE PROMPT, not per source line: the detector
#       strips carriage returns, then joins the captured text's lines with a
#       real newline at each blank-line paragraph break (so unrelated
#       paragraphs are not silently merged into one matchable run, and grep's
#       own per-line matching enforces the boundary with no ". "-join trick
#       that a trailing period could defeat) before running the
#       character-distance patterns, so an
#       instruction that an LLM wrapped across lines is judged by character
#       distance the same way a single-line instruction is, instead of being
#       missed purely because grep's default matching is per line. Two
#       disclosed ceilings from that join: (1) two unrelated lines can still
#       coincidentally satisfy the character-distance budget once joined, for
#       example a markdown heading immediately followed by an unrelated
#       bullet mentioning checklist.json with no terminal period between
#       them - a real but narrow risk, not eliminated by this fix; (2) the
#       verification-array-literal signature additionally now requires
#       "checklist" to also appear within the same character-distance budget
#       of the array, so an unrelated JSON `"verification": [` array (for
#       example one explicitly prohibited: "do not touch verification: []
#       in ci-config.json") does not by itself fire the signature - but the
#       narrowed check is still blind to negation: an instruction that says
#       NOT to touch a checklist's verification array, if "checklist" also
#       appears nearby, still fires it. BOTH detectors remain purely
#       textual: neither runs, stubs, or simulates an implementer session,
#       so neither can catch a model that goes off-script and authors checks
#       despite a clean prompt. That ceiling is real; closing it would
#       require executing or faithfully stubbing an implementer agent, which
#       is not fast/deterministic enough for this moat suite.
#
#   P3.check-author-context-excludes-implementation
#       The check-authoring step's input contains the spec and none of the
#       repo's implementation files.
#
#   P3.checks-frozen-before-eval
#       A checklist edited after it was frozen is rejected by the deterministic
#       verifier (autonomy/checklist-verify.py) with a hash mismatch reason.
#
# ASSUMED INTERFACES (not built yet; the milestone builder implements to these):
#
#   A. Check-author context (P3.check-author-context-excludes-implementation):
#        python3 autonomy/lib/check_author.py context --spec <spec> --repo <dir>
#      Prints to stdout, and exits 0, ONE JSON object that is the exact and
#      complete input handed to the check-authoring model. No model call, no
#      network, deterministic:
#        {"spec_sha256": "<hex>",
#         "inputs": [{"path": "<path>", "sha256": "<hex>"}, ...],
#         "prompt": "<full text given to the check author>"}
#      "inputs" lists every file whose content reaches the check author. The
#      spec must be among them; no file of the repo's implementation may be.
#
#   B. Freeze (P3.checks-frozen-before-eval):
#        python3 autonomy/checklist-verify.py --checklist <path> --freeze
#      Records a digest of the check DEFINITIONS (ids and verification specs,
#      never the result fields the verifier writes back: passed, output,
#      status, verified_at, summary, last_verified_at). Exit 0 on success.
#      Afterwards a plain verify run (no --freeze) recomputes the digest; on a
#      mismatch it exits non-zero, prints a reason containing "hash mismatch"
#      to stdout or stderr, and does not report the edited checks as verified.
#      The verifier's own write-back must NOT trip the digest on a re-run.
#
# Contract: one "CASE <ID> PASS|FAIL <desc>" stdout line per case; diagnostics
# on stderr; exit 0 when the script ran to completion. Hermetic, no network.

# Broader signature detector (BACKLOG 40; reworked under S-09, round 2).
# Independent of detect_check_authoring above and never substituted for it:
# this only ADDS coverage. It matches check-authoring signatures that survive
# a rename of PRD_CHECKLIST_INIT and a reword of its instruction text: any
# authoring verb near "checklist.json" (the "([^.]|\.[^[:space:]]){0,160}"
# gap crosses a dotted path such as ".loki/checklist/checklist.json" without
# stopping at the first dot, but still stops at a ". " sentence break inside
# a paragraph, or at a real line break where the joined text puts a
# paragraph boundary), a
# literal JSON "verification": [ array that also has "checklist" within the
# same gap budget, or the "(file_exists, ...command)" type-enum shape.
#
# grep's default matching is per line: a verb and "checklist.json" on
# separate source lines are invisible to a character-distance pattern no
# matter how close together they are, because the regex engine never sees
# past the line boundary. Real LLM-authored prose wraps constantly, so a
# character-budget claim that silently stops at every line break is far
# narrower than it looks. To make the character-distance behavior in the
# comment above true in practice, this detector runs the three patterns
# against a JOINED copy of the file: a mid-paragraph line wrap (a newline
# with no blank line around it) becomes a single space, so a wrapped
# sentence still reads as one line for grep. A blank line (a paragraph
# break) becomes a REAL newline in the joined output instead - not a fake
# ". " marker - so grep's own per-line matching enforces the paragraph
# boundary for free. Round 1 used ". " for this, but a paragraph that
# already ends in a period then joined to "..", and the gap pattern's
# "\.[^[:space:]]" branch treats two periods in a row as a non-terminating
# character and lets the match cross the paragraph boundary anyway - the
# opposite of the intended fix. A real newline has no such edge case: the
# paragraph break is a genuine line break in the joined text, not an in-line
# character sequence a regex can slip through. Carriage returns are also
# stripped from each line before the blank-line test runs, because a CRLF
# blank line's raw content is the single character "\r", not the empty
# string - without stripping first, awk's own "$0==\"\"" test never
# recognizes it as blank, so the line joins with a plain space instead of a
# real newline and the paragraph break is silently erased, letting a match
# cross a genuine CRLF paragraph boundary it should have stopped at (a false
# positive, the same class of bug the round-1 fix ". " join produced, just
# reached through CRLF instead of a trailing period).
# Only the joined copy is matched here; detect_check_authoring above is
# untouched and still line-oriented.
#
# Disclosed ceilings, not fixed here:
#   - the join can still coincidentally satisfy the character budget for two
#     unrelated lines joined by a mid-paragraph wrap (no blank line between
#     them), for example a markdown heading directly followed on the next
#     line by an unrelated bullet that mentions checklist.json - only a
#     blank-line paragraph break stops a match, a bare line wrap does not
#     (that is the gap this detector exists to close);
#   - the verification-array-literal signature requires "checklist" nearby
#     to avoid firing on an unrelated JSON "verification": [ array (for
#     example one explicitly prohibited: "do not touch verification: [] in
#     ci-config.json"), but it is still blind to negation - a sentence that
#     says NOT to touch a checklist's verification array still fires it;
#   - the type-enum signature requires file_exists to appear before command
#     inside the parens, in that order, so a verification-type list in a
#     different order or spelled out prose would still slip it.
# Measured against the real captured prompts on both routes (see
# case_prompt_no_check_authoring): today's PRD_CHECKLIST_INIT text fires the
# verb and type-enum signatures on both cold prompts, and all three
# signatures are silent on both warm prompts, which carry no checklist text
