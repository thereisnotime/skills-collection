# WHY THIS EXISTS. release.yml's "Extract changelog for this version" step
# used to be:
#   awk "/^## v$VERSION\$/{flag=1; next} /^## v/{flag=0} flag" CHANGELOG.md
# CHANGELOG headings are "## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)", not a bare "## vX.Y.Z"
# line, so the anchored regex never matched -- and VERSION was spliced into
# an ERE unescaped, so its dots matched any character too. Both bugs
# silently fell back to a one-line "Release vX.Y.Z" body. v9.80.1, v9.81.0,
# v10.0.1, v10.1.0, v10.1.1 and v10.2.1 shipped with that placeholder and
# were hand-fixed after the fact.
#
# LOKI_ALLOW_UNSCANNED_PUSH=1 on every real hook invocation below (E-110):
# this suite is about the release-notes gate, not gitleaks, and CI's Tests
# job (tests/run-all-tests.sh, which runs this file) does not install the
# pinned gitleaks binary -- without the override, every push here would be
# refused by the hook's (unrelated) full-push secret scan requiring it.
