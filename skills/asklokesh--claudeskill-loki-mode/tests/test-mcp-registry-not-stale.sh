# The PUBLISHED MCP registry entry must not fall behind what we ship.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. tests/test-server-json-current.sh already guards that
# server.json tracks VERSION, and it passes. Both of those values are LOCAL, so
# they agree with each other while saying nothing about what the registry
# actually serves to users.
#
# Measured 2026-09-13, with both files green:
#
#   server.json                      9.49.4
#   VERSION                          9.49.4
#   registry.modelcontextprotocol.io 7.34.1   <- 40+ releases behind
#
# A user discovering the server through the registry gets an npm pin of 7.34.1.
# Nothing in the repository could detect that, because nothing compared a local
# value to a remote one.
#
# NETWORK-DEPENDENT BY NATURE, so this does NOT belong in the fast tier: a
# pre-push gate that reaches the internet fails on a plane, in CI without egress,
# and whenever the registry has an outage, and none of those are defects in this
# repository. It is written for a scheduled workflow and for manual use.
#
# ADVISORY BY DEFAULT, and that default is load-bearing.
#
# Drift here is closable ONLY by a human with registry publisher credentials.
# A red that no engineer working in this repository can clear is the thing that
# teaches people to ignore reds, so the default path REPORTS drift and exits 0.
# This follows tests/test-model-catalog-staleness.sh, which reports external
# data going stale "WITHOUT ever changing an exit code" and names that invariant
# advisory. Same shape: external state we do not control.
#
# I learned this the expensive way. The first version of this guard exited 1 on
# drift and was registered in run-all-tests.sh, which .github/workflows/test.yml
# runs in every shard on every push. It turned a publishing gap nobody in the
# repo could fix into a failing Tests run (93989130, shard 1, the only failure
# in that shard).
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0  in sync, unreachable, OR drift in advisory mode (the default)
#   1  drift, ONLY when LOKI_MCP_REGISTRY_STRICT=1 asks for a hard signal
#   2  a local precondition is broken (missing VERSION, unparseable server.json)
#
# The nightly parity-drift workflow sets STRICT so it can branch on rc and open
# an issue. Nothing on the push path sets it.
