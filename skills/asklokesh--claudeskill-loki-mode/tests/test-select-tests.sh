# tests/test-select-tests.sh -- fixture tests for scripts/select-tests.sh
# (S-91 Tier A selector). Drives the selector via --files (no real commits
# needed) so each rule R0-R7 has a deterministic scenario, plus the
# unparseable-diff fallback in git mode.
#
# Perf (S-136): scripts/select-tests.sh is a pure function of its changed-file
# list against a fixed repo state, but each invocation is its own process
# (~5-6s of grep/xargs fan-out over the test tree). ~30 distinct inputs run
# serially blew past the 60s cap. Every distinct input below is queued up
# front (deduped by content), run MAX_PAR-wide in the background, then each
# case reads its answer back from cache instead of re-invoking the selector.
# The prefetch list for `sel 'X'` cases is extracted from this file's own
# source (self-inspection) so it can never drift from the call sites below;
# assertions and their messages are all unchanged, so a dropped rule in
# scripts/select-tests.sh still fails the exact case it always did.
