# Asserts the pre-push hook's eval-fixture gitleaks step (E-86).
#
# CI's Security Audit gitleaks gate (git-log mode, full history) only runs
# AFTER a push already landed, and a false positive there (sourcegraph-access-
# token on eval/loki10/tasks/pub-werkzeug-3271/task.json:8, blocking v10.2.0,
# run 36440534022) is exactly the class of finding this hook step catches
# locally, before the push. Cases:
#
#   1. a task.json with a sourcegraph.com URL + a 40-hex ref is refused
#   2. the same, with its dir-mode fingerprint in .gitleaksignore, passes
#   3. a push touching no eval/loki10/tasks or eval/loki10/refdiff file skips
#      without invoking gitleaks at all
#   4. eval files changed but the pinned gitleaks v8.30.0 is unavailable
#      (HOME pointed at a scratch dir with no pinned install; PATH may still
#      carry an off-pin gitleaks, e.g. Homebrew's 8.30.1, which must not
#      satisfy the version-exact-match check) -> refused, with the install
#      command
#   5. pushing a brand-new branch (remote sha all zeros) that IS the checked-
#      out branch, adding a secret-shaped task.json, is refused. Regression
#      guard: an earlier version of this step computed the new-branch diff
#      base as `git merge-base $local_sha HEAD`, but pushing your own checked-
#      out branch means local_sha == HEAD, so that merge-base is always
#      local_sha itself and the diff against it is always empty -- a fail-open
#      that skipped the scan on the single most common new-branch push.
#   6. deleting a ref (local sha all zeros) is allowed and never invokes
#      gitleaks, even when eval files existed on the now-deleted branch.
#   7. eval changes on a ref that is NOT the one currently checked out are
#      scanned (from the pushed commit, not the working tree -- see r2 below)
#      and refused on the finding, same as case 1.
#
# r2 rework (Opus REJECT on 9c8447b1, reproduced with a real `git push` and
# the real pinned gitleaks 8.30.0): the scan now reads the PUSHED COMMIT's
# committed blobs (`git archive "$_lsha"` into a throwaway dir), not the
# working tree, and the pinned gitleaks binary is trusted only when a sidecar
# checksum recorded at install time still matches its bytes. Cases 8-12 are
# real-`git push`-to-a-real-bare-remote fixtures (core.hooksPath, non-
# stdin-fed) covering exactly the four fail-open bugs that rejection found,
# plus the exit-code and sidecar-mismatch behavior that fix required:
#   8.  a non-ASCII task dir name (e.g. an accented character) is scanned,
#       not silently skipped by `cut`'s misparse of git's quoted diff output
#   9.  a force-push whose remote sha was never fetched locally is scanned
#       (fallback to merge-base with the remote-tracking main), not read as
#       "no eval changes" because `git diff` on an unknown sha failed
#   10. a secret committed then "cleaned" only in the working tree (never
#       recommitted) is still caught, because the scan reads the commit
#   11. a gitleaks exit code other than 0 or 1 is reported as "gitleaks
#       failed (exit N)", not misreported as a found secret -- still refused
#   12. a pinned binary whose sidecar checksum no longer matches its bytes is
#       treated as not installed, not trusted on `gitleaks version` alone
#
# Cases 13-14 cover the fourth bug (scripts/install-gitleaks.sh), network-free
# by pointing the installer's LOKI_GITLEAKS_BASE_URL at a local `file://`
# fixture instead of the real GitHub release:
#   13. a `file://` origin serving a fake tarball is refused before
#       extraction, the fake binary is never executed or installed, and the
#       refusal message includes the actual (wrong) hash -- proving the
#       fixture origin was really used, not silently skipped in favor of a
#       real download
#   14. a pinned binary with no (or a mismatched) sidecar is reinstalled and
#       re-verified, never trusted on `gitleaks version` alone the way
#       9c8447b1's installer trusted it
#
# LOKI_TEST_INSTALLER_OLD, if set, points at a checked-out pre-r2 copy of
# scripts/install-gitleaks.sh; case 14 runs it too and asserts it reproduces
# the "already installed" fail-open (red-first evidence). Unset, only the
# real installer at scripts/install-gitleaks.sh is asserted. Case 13 has no
# equivalent old-script rung: 9c8447b1's installer does not read
# LOKI_GITLEAKS_BASE_URL at all (it hardcodes the GitHub URL), so there is no
# network-free way to point it at this fixture; its red-first evidence is a
# manual repro (sed-patch the base URL, verify EVIL_EXECUTED), not this test.
#
# Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 need the real pinned gitleaks v8.30.0 to be
# meaningful -- a stub binary could not reproduce the actual rule engine's
# behavior. When it is not installed at $HOME/.local/share/loki/bin/
# gitleaks-8.30.0 WITH a matching sidecar checksum, those cases print SKIP
# and are not counted as pass. Cases 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13 and 14 need no real
# gitleaks rule engine (11-14 use stub/fixture binaries) and always run for
# real, except case 13's two assertions, which SKIP on an unsupported
# OS/arch combination (none exist for this repo's supported platforms).
#
# LOKI_TEST_HOOK_OVERRIDE lets a caller point this test at a different hook
# file (e.g. a checked-out pre-E-86 copy) to demonstrate red-then-green;
# unset, it asserts the real hook at .githooks/pre-push as normal.
#
# r3 rework (Opus re-review of 4e882432, reproduced with real pushes): the
# scan covered only the pushed TIP's tree, so a secret added in one commit
# and removed again (file deleted, or edited clean) by a LATER commit of the
# SAME push was never scanned locally, yet it lands in the remote's history
# and CI's git-log-mode gitleaks flags it only afterward. Every commit in the
# pushed range is now archived and scanned from its own tree. Cases 15-21:
#   15 (N1a). added-then-deleted-later secret: refused, naming the add commit
#   16 (N1b). added-then-edited-clean-later secret: refused, same as N1a
#   17. a clean multi-commit push (no secret in any commit) passes
#   18. a merge commit bringing in a secret (not present on either parent's
#       tip alone from the base) is refused
#   19. an added .gitleaksignore line prints a WARNING, not a refusal
#   20. a .gitleaks.toml adding a global ('.*') allowlist is refused unless
#       LOKI_ALLOW_GITLEAKS_CONFIG_CHANGE=1, and passes with it set
#   21. a single commit with 2,000 changed eval files completes (chunked
#       `git archive`, not one `Argument list too long` call)
#
# E-99 rework (E-86 round-4 review C1, real production incident: a release
# train refused at 18:26Z on an already-reviewed false positive that a
# MERGED OLDER branch commit's own, pre-dated .gitleaksignore did not yet
# allowlist, while CI -- which scans the whole pushed range against ONE
# ignore file, the tip's -- passed): every commit is now scanned against the
# PUSHED TIP's .gitleaksignore / .gitleaks.toml (`git show "$_lsha:..."`),
# not each commit's own. GITLEAKS_CONFIG / GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML are unset
# before invoking gitleaks. The .gitleaks.toml refusal is no longer scoped
# to an eval-touching push. The pinned binary is now also checked against a
# sha256 hardcoded per-platform in this hook's own git history, not only its
# sidecar. Cases 22, 23, 26 and 11 are updated to match (behavior legitimately
# changed); 29 and 30 are new:
#   22. a .gitleaks.toml-only change (no eval touch) is NOW refused too,
#       same as a change that also touches eval (was: allowed -- r4 scoped
#       the refusal to eval-touching pushes; a config change is dangerous on
#       its own merits, independent of what else this push touches)
#   26. a .gitleaksignore line added in commit 1 and removed again in commit
#       2 of the SAME push is NOW refused (was: passed) -- commit 1's secret
#       is scanned against the TIP's .gitleaksignore, which no longer has
#       the suppressing line, matching what CI's git-log-mode scan would find
#   11. repurposed: a binary whose sha256 differs from the hardcoded
#       per-platform value never runs, even with a self-computed sidecar
#       that matches it byte-for-byte (a sidecar match alone was the old bar)
#   29. the production incident itself, reproduced: a merge bringing in an
#       old branch commit whose own .gitleaksignore lacks an entry passes
#       when the pushed TIP's .gitleaksignore has it
#   30. GITLEAKS_CONFIG pointing at a permissive config (outside the repo)
#       is ignored -- the hook unsets it before invoking gitleaks
#
# E-119: case 35 covers the same fail-closed property as case 28, but for the
# OTHER `git rev-list` call -- the one that decides whether .gitleaks.toml
# changed in the pushed range (line ~319). It used `|| true`, so a rev-list
# error read as "config unchanged" and fell back to trusting the pushed
# tip's own (possibly weakened) config, instead of refusing:
#   35. a `git` wrapper placed on PATH makes `rev-list ... -- .gitleaks.toml`
#       exit non-zero; the push is refused with the hook's own message, not
#       silently treated as no config change

# invocation style (a real `git push`'s hook cannot be used here: a real git
# process prepends its own `--exec-path` libexec directory to the hook's
# PATH, ahead of anything a test puts there first, so a PATH-only wrapper
# never reaches a hook launched that way -- confirmed empirically, not just
# reasoned; run_hook_raw's plain `bash .githooks/pre-push` invocation has no
# such prepend). The wrapper exits non-zero for exactly the
# `rev-list ... -- .gitleaks.toml` call the fixed gate makes (matched by
# exact-arg, so it never touches the hook's other git calls), and execs the
# real git binary for everything else. The wrapped PATH is confined to the
# subshell below so it never leaks into the rest of this test file.
