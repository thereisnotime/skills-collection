"""Report modules that SHIP to users but nothing at runtime can reach.

This repo has a recurring defect: a subsystem is built, tested, listed in
package.json files[], and never wired to anything that runs. It passes CI (its
own tests import it), it ships to every npm user, and it does nothing. The
CHANGELOG then describes it as a feature.

The distinction that matters is NOT "does anything reference this file" -- tests
and CI smoke-imports reference everything. It is "does any RUNTIME path reach
it". A module referenced only by its own tests and by a workflow that does
`node -e "require(...)"` is proven to LOAD, not to RUN.

Exit 0 = every entry has a runtime reachability verdict recorded in
ALLOWLIST below. Exit 1 = an unlisted unreachable module ships. Exit 2 = the
scan could not run (unmeasured, never reported as clean).

Adding an entry to ALLOWLIST is a deliberate act: it records that someone
looked and decided shipping it is correct, with the reason. It is not a way to
silence the check.
