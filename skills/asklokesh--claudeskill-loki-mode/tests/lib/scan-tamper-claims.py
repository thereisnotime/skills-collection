"""Report any surface that CLAIMS the audit chain is tamper-proof.

It is not: both chain implementations accept a fully re-forged history, because
the hash is unkeyed and the genesis is a constant. See
docs/AUDIT-CHAIN-THREAT-MODEL.md for the reproduction.

Matching is per OCCURRENCE, not per line. A line-level negative filter is
exploitable, and was: inserting "tamper-proof" into a line that already read
"not tamper-proof against ..." exempted the whole line, and the mutation test
stayed green. Each occurrence is judged by the words immediately around it, so
an honest caveat cannot launder a false claim sharing its line.

Exit 0 = no claims found. Exit 1 = claims found (printed, one per line).
Exit 2 = could not scan (reported as unmeasured, never as clean).
