# BACKLOG 48 / D7 same-class hardening: `loki outcomes canary verify` and the
# inline python3 heredocs behind `loki proof share`/`loki proof show`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. D7 (docs/v10/DECISIONS.md) established that a verify path's
# Python invocation must not let the checkout under verification supply the
# verifier's own modules: python3 runs with -E (PYTHONPATH and a committed
# sitecustomize.py are both blocked before any in-script guard can run), and
# each inline heredoc drops '' and '.' from sys.path before its first real
# import. That guard was applied to the base proof verifier and the
# attestation checks, but not to `outcomes canary verify` or the proof
# share/show heredocs.
#
# THIS FILE ADDS A SECOND, RELATED THREAT the earlier D7 sites did not need:
# a NON-ABSOLUTE PATH COMPONENT. A leading/embedded "" in $PATH (what
# `PATH="x:$PATH"` on an unset PATH, or a stray `PATH=":$PATH"`, leaves) is
# treated by the shell exactly like ".", and so is any OTHER relative entry
# (a bare "bin", "./tools", ...): if the current directory (or a relative
# subdirectory of it) happens to be part of the checkout under
# verification/sharing and contains a file named python3, an unscoped
# `python3 ...` invocation runs THAT FILE, not the real interpreter -- no need
# to control any real, absolute PATH directory. -E alone does not close this:
# -E stops the environment from redirecting an already-resolved python3, it
# does nothing about which binary "python3" resolves to in the first place.
#
# THE RED LEG'S REFERENCE POINT MUST BE FIXED, NOT "HEAD". A first version of
# this test built its pre-fix comparison copy via `git show HEAD:autonomy/loki`.
# That only demonstrates the bug up until this test's own commit lands: once
# merged, HEAD *is* the fix, so the RED leg would silently and permanently stop
# demonstrating anything (every RED control would report "harness could not
# reproduce" forever, on every future run, on every branch). Instead this file
# pins a literal, unmoving SHA -- the immediate parent of the commit that added
# this fix -- captured once, below, as a constant. That commit predates this
# fix on every branch it is ever merged into, by construction, so `git show
# <PINNED_SHA>:autonomy/loki` always answers with the pre-fix source, no matter
# how much history accumulates on top of it afterward.
#
# A pinned SHA is only useful if it is actually fetchable: a shallow checkout
# (e.g. actions/checkout's default fetch-depth: 1, used by this repo's
# shell-tests CI job) will not have it. When that happens this file prints an
# explicit SKIP line and does not count the RED leg as PASS or FAIL, so a
# shallow CI run is visibly a skip in the log, never a silent, indistinguishable
# green. The GREEN legs (which need no history at all) still always run.
#
# RED is run against this pinned pre-fix `autonomy/loki` with a committed
# python3 shim sitting in the current directory and a non-absolute PATH entry:
# the shim runs and its fabricated output reaches the user. GREEN is the same
# attack against the working tree: the shim never runs, and the real tool's
# honest answer (or refusal) comes through instead.
