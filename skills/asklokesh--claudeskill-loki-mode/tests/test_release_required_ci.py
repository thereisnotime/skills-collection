"""The release gate must fail closed on the required workflows at the exact SHA.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. Every publish job (npm, PyPI, TS SDK, Docker, Homebrew)
hangs off `needs: release`. Before required-ci existed, `release` needed only
`gate`, which runs the suite on Python 3.12 ONLY and never consults the
security audit. A VERSION push could publish to every channel while the Tests
matrix was still running, or already red on 3.10, 3.11 or 3.13.

TWO FAILURE MODES ARE ASSERTED HERE, and the second is the subtle one:

  1. The decision rules must treat anything other than an explicit success as
     not-a-pass. `cancelled` is the case that actually occurred in this repo:
     a Tests run was cancelled when a newer push superseded it, and a check
     that only tests for `failure` reads that as publishable.

  2. A required workflow must actually RUN at a release commit. Security Audit
     originally triggered on pull_request and a weekly cron only, so a release
     SHA had no Security Audit run at all. Requiring it without also adding a
     push trigger would deadlock every release instead of gating it -- a gate
     that can never pass is not stricter, it is broken. The trigger and the
     REQUIRED list have to change together, so this test pins both.
