# Every tool `loki doctor` marks REQUIRED must appear in the README's install
# prerequisites, under "Required:" and not under "Recommended:".
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. README.md listed `jq` under "Recommended:" ("for nicer JSON
# handling in shell flows") while doctor marked it required, turned it into a
# `fail`, and pushed "jq is not installed" into the blockers list. A reader who
# installed exactly what the README called Required got a doctor that refused to
# pass, naming a tool the README had told them was optional. Node.js had the
# same split, and the README demanded Python 3.10+ where doctor enforces 3.8.
#
# The direction is deliberate: doctor is the authority. It is the thing that
# actually blocks, so prose that disagrees with it is the side that is wrong.
# This guard therefore reads the required set OUT of doctor and asserts the
# README covers it -- adding a required tool to doctor without a README entry
# fails here.
#
# BOTH routes carry the list (loki-ts/src/commands/doctor.ts TOOL_SPECS and
# autonomy/loki doctor_check), so a tool added to only one of them is a gap the
# README could not reveal. The two lists are asserted equal as well.
