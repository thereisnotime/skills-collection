#
# Mutation-style proof that a diff selects the suites that guard it:
#   - loki-ts/src/commands/doctor.ts selects the doctor bun and shell suites;
#   - docker/Dockerfile.control-plane selects tests/test-control-plane.sh (CP-04),
#     which the selector alone sends to "R0 unknown path shape";
#   - a workflow edit selects the workflow guards, not the full set;
#   - an unrelated docs edit selects NO doctor suite (the selection is not
#     "everything");
#   - an uncomputable diff fails safe to FULL;
#   - the planner's R0 path list agrees with scripts/select-tests.sh.
