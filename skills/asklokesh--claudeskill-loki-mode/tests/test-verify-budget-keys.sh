# Budget spend-key contract: every READER must read the key the WRITERS emit.
#
# Two shipped defects motivated this suite, both the same class and both
# invisible to the existing tests because every fixture wrote the key the
# reader wanted instead of the key production writes:
#
#   1. loki_remaining_budget (autonomy/lib/claude-flags.sh) and its byte-mirror
#      remainingBudget (loki-ts/src/providers/claude_flags.ts) read
#      "current_spend". NO production writer has ever emitted that key. Spend
#      therefore read 0 forever and --max-budget-usd received the FULL cap on
#      every call instead of the remainder, so the per-call backstop never
#      tightened as spend accumulated.
#
#   2. check_budget_threshold (autonomy/notification-checker.py) read "used"
#      from the "budget" sub-dict of dashboard-state.json. run.sh:7084 nests
#      .loki/metrics/budget.json there verbatim, and that file's key is
#      "budget_used", so the budget-80pct notification never fired in
#      production.
#
# Every fixture below is written in the EXACT shape run.sh emits
# (limit/budget_limit/budget_used/exceeded). That is load-bearing: a fixture
# carrying only the new key would still pass a reader that kept the old key as
# its first choice.
#
# Each assertion is individual and named. No count thresholds: a threshold
# cannot say WHICH reader regressed.
