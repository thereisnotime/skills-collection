"""
Wave-6 hardening regression tests for memory/storage.py.

Each test drives the REAL MemoryStorage object against a throwaway tempdir
and asserts one specific failure mode does not recur. Every test is
non-vacuous: the docstring states exactly what the pre-fix code did (the
observable failure the assertion rules out), so a passing run is meaningful.

Run directly:  python3 tests/test_storage_wave6.py
