# LOKI_MAX_DURATION must stop a run that has exceeded its wall-clock cap.
#
# WHY A THIRD BOUND EXISTS. Spend was capped (LOKI_BUDGET_LIMIT) and iterations
# were capped (LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS), but a run that STALLS is bounded by
# neither: a hung provider call or a wedged subprocess burns hours while
# spending almost nothing and completing no iteration, so neither existing
# breaker trips. This project has already paid for that shape once -- a run
# burned $34 to an external timeout because the safety valve was watching a
# signal the default path no longer emitted.
#
# An external kill (activeDeadlineSeconds, a CI job timeout) does stop the
# process, but it SIGKILLs it: no terminal status is written, so the receipt
# cannot say what happened and the platform sees a crash rather than a
# deliberate stop. This cap stops the loop cleanly at an iteration boundary.
#
# TESTED WITHOUT A PAID RUN. check_max_duration is a pure function of two
# values -- the cap and the run's start epoch -- so it is exercised directly by
# setting those. Starting a real build and waiting for a timeout would cost
# money and take as long as the cap.
