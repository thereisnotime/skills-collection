# Test: the council must never fabricate a reviewer vote.
#
# THE BUG (found 2026-07-29 while auditing provider coupling)
#   Every provider arm in council-v2.sh substituted a literal
#     {"verdict":"REJECT","reasoning":"review execution failed","issues":[]}
#   on ANY miss -- CLI absent, timeout, transient error, unparseable output --
#   and the tally counted "anything not APPROVE" as a rejection:
#
#     if [ "$verdict" = "APPROVE" ]; then ((approve_count++)); else ((reject_count++)); fi
#
#   So the engine recorded a REJECT the model never gave, and BLOCKED the run on
#   it. Twelve such sites existed across five providers, plus the devil's
#   advocate defaulting to REJECT on a parse failure -- which could silently
#   overturn a unanimous APPROVE on a transient error.
#
#   This is the same defect class as an Evidence Receipt attesting to a diff
#   stat it never measured: the artifact asserts a fact nobody established.
#
#   It is worst on a cheap/weak model. Low format compliance became a permanent
#   BLOCK that reads to the user as "Loki is broken" rather than "your model
#   could not produce a parseable verdict". That failure mode is squarely in the
#   way of running this engine on anything but a frontier model.
#
# THE RULE
#   A verdict that was never obtained is INCONCLUSIVE. It is counted separately,
#   never as a rejection, and it is reported to the user.
#
# Proven directions:
#   NOFAB    : no fabricated REJECT literal remains in the source.
#   TALLY    : the tally has a distinct INCONCLUSIVE arm; non-APPROVE no longer
#              means REJECT.
#   REALREJECT: a genuine REJECT is still counted as a rejection (the fix must
#              not blind the council to real rejections).
#   DA       : an unparseable devil's advocate does NOT overturn a unanimous
#              approval.
#   VISIBLE  : inconclusive reviewers are reported, not swallowed.
#   PARSE    : the parse-failure path -- the weak-model case -- yields
#              INCONCLUSIVE, not REJECT.
