#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Every real top-level command must appear in BOTH shell completions.
#
# WHY A COVERAGE GATE RATHER THAN THREE ASSERTIONS. `handoff`, `receipt` and
# `cp` were each missing from a completion file. Adding three named checks
# would fix those three and catch none of the next ones. This repo has shipped
# a command without its cross-cutting registrations at least four separate
# times -- it is a CLASS of defect, and a per-feature test cannot see a class.
#
# WHY THIS PROBES THE CLI INSTEAD OF PARSING IT. Static extraction does not
# work here, and this is the interesting part. `autonomy/loki` dispatches on a
# large case statement, but NESTED case statements (subcommand arguments) sit
# at the same indentation as the top-level ones. Parsing by indent yields
# `python`, `jest`, `rust`, `critical` and ~70 others as "missing commands" --
# all false positives, all subcommand arguments. Measured: naive parsing
# reported 239 candidates; probing the CLI found 111 real commands.
#
# So the only reliable oracle is the CLI itself: a real command does not answer
# "Unknown command". That is slower than a grep and it is correct, which is the
# right trade for a gate that must not cry wolf.

# argument reaching the top level prints "Unknown command".
# TWO NON-OBVIOUS REQUIREMENTS, each of which silently broke this probe once.
#
# 1. The output is CAPTURED, then matched -- never `cli | head | grep -q`.
#    Under `set -o pipefail` (on above), `head` closes the pipe as soon as it
#    has its lines, the CLI dies of SIGPIPE, and the PIPELINE's status is
#    nonzero no matter what grep found. Every candidate then looks real: the
#    gate reported 269 commands instead of 112 and flagged ~90 subcommand
#    arguments as missing completions. The identical logic outside pipefail
#    behaved correctly, which is what made it confusing.
#
# 2. `</dev/null` keeps the CLI from consuming the loop's stdin, which would
#    otherwise eat the candidate list after the first iteration.
