# tests/test-build-home-isolation.sh -- F49 regression test.
#
# Bug: during a real `loki start` build, Loki executes/tests the GENERATED app
# (the app-runner server launch + the project's own test suite in
# enforce_test_coverage). Those child processes inherited Loki's environment,
# including the user's REAL $HOME. A generated app that defaults its state file
# to a HOME-relative path (a todo CLI writing ~/.todo.json is the reported
# case) then littered the user's home directory with Loki's in-build test data.
#
# Fix: run.sh wraps those in-build executions in _loki_with_app_sandbox, which
# points HOME/XDG/TMPDIR at an isolated directory under .loki/app-sandbox for
# the duration of the call and restores the real environment afterward.
#
# Strategy: extract the real _loki_app_sandbox_dir() and _loki_with_app_sandbox()
# from run.sh, source them, and PROVE by repro that:
#   (1) a wrapped command writing to $HOME/.todo.json lands in the sandbox, NOT
#       the real HOME (the exact reported leak),
#   (2) XDG_CONFIG_HOME/XDG_DATA_HOME are redirected into the sandbox too,
#   (3) the real environment is restored EXACTLY after the call (a previously
#       unset var stays unset; a previously set var keeps its value), so the
#       next iteration's provider invocation still sees the real HOME,
#   (4) the wrapper preserves the wrapped command's exit code.
