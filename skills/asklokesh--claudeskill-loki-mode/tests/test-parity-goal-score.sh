# loki-ts/src/runner/goal_score.ts goalSharpeningInstruction() and the
# goal_sharpening_instruction block in autonomy/run.sh must return the same
# bytes for the same goal. Instead of grepping for constants, this extracts the
# LIVE run.sh block, runs it in bash for every corpus goal, runs the real TS
# function in Bun for the same goals, and cmp's the outputs. The corpus is built
# from every regex alternative found on BOTH sides, so a token added, dropped or
# renamed on either side changes one line. Skips cleanly without bun.
