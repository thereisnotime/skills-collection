# Test: a non-Claude provider must not default to a Claude model.
#
# THE BUG (found 2026-07-29 auditing provider coupling)
#   providers/model_catalog.json configured BOTH aider and cline with
#     latest_planning:    claude-opus-4-8
#     latest_development: claude-sonnet-5
#     latest_fast:        claude-sonnet-5
#   and contained ZERO open-weight models -- no DeepSeek, GLM, Qwen, Kimi,
#   MiniMax. Three of the four providers defaulted to Claude.
#
#   So a user who switched provider specifically to stop paying frontier prices
#   kept paying them, silently, unless they happened to know to set
#   LOKI_MODEL_OVERRIDE. The one-file data default actively defeated the reason
#   to switch.
#
#   It is also backwards on the merits: aider and cline are the providers that
#   natively reach cheap models (verified on this machine --
#   `aider --list-models openrouter/` returns deepseek v3.2/r1, minimax-m2.1 and
#   :free variants), while we ranked them "degraded" for being un-Claude-like.
#
#   Context for why cheap defaults are defensible: on SWE-bench's uniform
#   scaffold batch (mini-swe-agent v2.0.0, 2026-02-17) MiniMax M2.5 resolved
#   75.8 at $36.64 total while Claude Opus 4.6 resolved 75.6 at $275.76 --
#   an open model matching frontier accuracy at ~7.5x lower cost.
#
# Proven directions:
#   NOCLAUDE : no non-claude provider has a claude-* model as a tier default.
#   OPEN     : the catalog actually contains open-weight models.
#   RESOLVES : loki_latest_model returns the non-Claude default for those
#              providers (the data change reaches the resolver).
#   OVERRIDE : the env override chain still wins (we changed data, not policy).
#   CLAUDE_OK: the claude provider still defaults to Claude (no over-correction).
#   VALID    : the catalog is still valid JSON with the expected schema.
