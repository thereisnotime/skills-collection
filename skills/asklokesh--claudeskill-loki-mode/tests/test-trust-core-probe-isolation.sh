# S-135: the trust-core probes run in parallel, so they must never touch the
# tree they were started from. A probe edits a source file in place for a whole
# test run; two probes in one tree see each other's breakage and report
# verdicts about code nobody wrote. Each worker must mutate its own private copy.
#
# Method: run the first few cases, three workers wide, against a disposable copy
# of this repo (so a regression here can never leave the real tree mutated), then
# require that no source file in that copy was written during the run. A probe
# rewrites its file twice (mutate, restore), so any in-place probe leaves a
# newer mtime behind even though the content ends identical.
