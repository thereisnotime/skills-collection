# The founder's headline use case must have a zero-install entry point.
#
# THE DEFECT: "hand Loki a GitHub issue and it resolves" had NO GitHub trigger
# at all for an npm user. The only published Action was `name: 'Loki Mode Code
# Review'` -- the wrong one -- and package.json files[] contained no workflow or
# action entry whatsoever, so nothing GitHub-side ever reached a user.
#
# WHAT IS LOAD-BEARING:
#  - both files must SHIP. This repo has spent four separate releases learning
#    that a check guarding the shipped artifact must itself be in files[].
#  - the workflow must be GATED. An agent that fires on every issue comment
#    would burn budget on unrelated chatter.
#  - it must FAIL FAST without a model key rather than burn 45 minutes.
#  - it must SERIALIZE per issue, or two agents race and open two PRs.
