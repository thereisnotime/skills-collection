# Asserts the pre-push hook's post-D27 contract.
#
# D27 (docs/v10/DECISIONS.md) retired the local pytest run from this hook --
# GitHub CI is the gate now. This file used to be test-pre-push-scoped-pytest.sh
# and asserted the removed scoping logic; it now asserts what replaced it:
#
#   1. wrong git identity on a github.com push -> hook blocks
#   2. a bash -n syntax error in autonomy/run.sh or autonomy/loki -> hook blocks
#   3. the hook source contains no pytest invocation (D27 removed it for good,
#      not just "skipped this run" -- a source check is the right tool here
#      because the property under test IS "this code path does not exist",
#      not runtime behavior a stub could fake)
#   4. a clean push-equivalent invocation completes in under 5 seconds,
#      measured 3 times on the real hook (no stubs)
#
# Every case runs the real hook in a scratch clone, never the real repo.
