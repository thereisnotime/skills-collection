# Test: RANK 15 -- lower the no-claim council convergence floor.
#
# The convergence-detection path (NO explicit completion claim) historically only
# evaluated on the CHECK_INTERVAL boundary (every 5th iteration). A no-promise /
# analysis run that is verifiably done at iteration 2 still ground to iteration 5
# before the council was even allowed to look. The RANK-15 change lets that path
# evaluate as soon as there is AFFIRMATIVE evidence of done (a real test suite
# passed, and the checklist -- if present -- is not failing), gated behind
# MIN_ITERATIONS and the LOKI_COUNCIL_CONVERGENCE_EARLY knob.
#
# This sources the REAL helpers from completion-council.sh so it cannot drift.
# It drives the pure decision helper _council_should_check_now directly (no need
# to spin a 3-member vote): that helper is exactly the WHEN-to-evaluate gate.
#
# Proven directions:
#   POSITIVE : no-claim, iter 2 (off the 5-interval), MIN=1, affirmative test-green
#              -> _council_should_check_now returns 0 (evaluate NOW).
#              RED before the change (no early bypass existed -> returns 1).
#   NEGATIVE-A (unverified): same iter, NO test-results file (no evidence)
#              -> stays 1 (does NOT fast-path). Green before AND after.
#   NEGATIVE-B (inconclusive): test-results present but runner=="none"
#              -> stays 1 (absence of a real suite is not affirmative green).
#              Green before AND after (proves we did not weaken safety).
#   NEGATIVE-C (red tests): test-results present, pass==false
#              -> stays 1. Green before AND after.
#   CADENCE   : no-claim, iter 5 (ON interval), no evidence -> still 0 (unchanged).
#   MIN-GUARD : no-claim, iter 2, MIN=3, affirmative green -> stays 1 (below floor).
#   OPT-OUT   : LOKI_COUNCIL_CONVERGENCE_EARLY=0 + affirmative green + iter 2
#              -> stays 1 (historical interval-only restored).
#   CLAIM     : explicit-claim path timing UNCHANGED (iter 7, claimed) -> 0,
#              and iter 7 unclaimed no-evidence -> 1.
