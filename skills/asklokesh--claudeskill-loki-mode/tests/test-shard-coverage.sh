# Sharding must PARTITION the suite list: every suite in exactly one shard.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT. Splitting 289 suites across N CI
# runners is only sound if the union of the shards is the original set. A shard
# filter that quietly drops a suite makes the gate faster AND blind, and a
# blind gate is worse than a slow one -- this repo already paid for that lesson
# once, when a shellcheck "optimization" ran ~2x faster and silently lost 2 real
# failures before being reverted.
#
# So this asserts the partition property directly, by counting what each shard
# would actually execute and comparing the total against an unsharded run.
# It does not execute the suites (that is the gate's job); it verifies the
# arithmetic that decides which ones get executed at all.
