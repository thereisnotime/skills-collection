# The shipped agent roles must actually reach the review pool.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: an earlier version of this file claimed the roles never
# loaded, because a probe that ran the selector standalone showed the pool going
# from 4 to 14 when LOKI_AGENTS_TYPES_FILE was set. That probe was wrong -- it
# omitted the export run.sh already performs. autonomy/run.sh:14764
# unconditionally exports LOKI_AGENTS_TYPES_FILE="${PROJECT_DIR}/agents/types.json"
# ten lines above the selector, so the 41 roles DO load in production today.
# The premise was refuted by mutation testing before anything shipped.
#
# What this suite does instead is PIN the working behaviour, because it is a
# three-part chain and any link can break silently:
#   1. agents/types.json exists,
#   2. agents/ is in package.json files[] so npm users get it,
#   3. run.sh exports the path, and the selector actually enlarges the pool.
# Break any one and the specialized roles quietly stop reaching reviews, with no
# error anywhere. Specialized reviewer roles are the axis competitors compete
# on, so a silent regression here is expensive and invisible.
#
# The assertions drive the REAL selector extracted from run.sh rather than a
# copy, so a change to the selector cannot leave this test green against a
# stale duplicate.
