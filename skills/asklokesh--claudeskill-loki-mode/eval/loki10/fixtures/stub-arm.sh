#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Stub arm for eval/loki10/test-harness.sh. Stands in for `claude` or `loki`
# (never the real CLIs). Behavior comes from STUB_MODE:
#   pass        fix greet.sh on a new branch, commit, push
#   cost        same as pass, and report total_cost_usd like claude -p json does
#   costpretty  same, as a pretty-printed multi-line JSON message array
#   nofix       push a branch that does not fix anything
#   emptypush   push a branch holding one empty commit (the no-op baseline)
#   noop        do nothing
#   sleep       sleep far past any cap (records PIDs in STUB_PID_FILE)
#   orphan      leave a background sleeper behind and exit 0 (PID in STUB_PID_FILE)
#   setsidorphan leave a setsid-detached sleeper (escapes the timeout process
#               group) behind and exit 0. PID (then "escaped" once confirmed)
#               in STUB_PID_FILE. STUB_ORPHAN_CHDIR: cd there first (default
#               "." = the clone, for the cwd-reap leg). STUB_ORPHAN_PIDFILE:
#               also record the sleeper's PID (and, with STUB_ORPHAN_DECOY_PID
#               set, that decoy PID plus a "-1" line) there, for the pidfile
#               reap leg and its negative controls.
#   exit0       push a greet.sh that exits 0 when sourced (skips the assertions)
#   symlink     pass, plus hidden_test.sh as a symlink to STUB_SYMLINK_TARGET
#   hardlink    no push; hidden_test.sh in the working tree is a hardlink to
#               STUB_HARDLINK_TARGET (the no-PR diagnostic grade copies there)
#   blocker     pass, plus a regular file named tests (blocks tests/hidden_test.sh)
#   chmodafter  pass, then make STUB_CHMOD_FILE unreadable
#   backdate    pass, then rewrite the remote push log to a time before the run
#   alreadydone (EV-13) print a claims_no_change_needed-matching line, no
#               changes, no push -- what a correct expected_outcome:
#               no_change_needed run looks like on raw-claude/legacy
#   dirtynoop   (EV-13) fix greet.sh but never commit or push it: a source
#               diff left in the working tree with no PR
#   check       only run the hidden-file leak check
# STUB_V10_MARKER=1|noevents|stale|oldpath|badfield writes the v10 engine
# marker (and events): oldpath uses the superseded .loki/events/<id>.jsonl,
# badfield points the marker's events field outside the contract path.
# STUB_V10_VERDICT (EV-13, with STUB_V10_MARKER set): also writes this run's
# receipt.json with the given "verdict" field.
# STUB_V10_WALL=1|fake (EV-13, with STUB_V10_MARKER and STUB_V10_VERDICT
#   set): 1 writes tests/loki_wall_probe.sh into the working tree
#   (untracked) plus its sealed copy under .loki/runs/stub-run/wall/ and
#   lists it in the receipt's wall.files with its real sha256 -- the same
#   side effect and evidence the real Wall stage leaves behind. fake
#   instead lists an existing REAL edit (dirtynoop's .stub-scratch.txt)
#   under wall.files with no sealed copy, to prove that alone is never
#   enough to exclude it.
# STUB_LOKI_COST=estimate|provider writes one loki efficiency record.
# Every mode first fails loudly if any hidden test file is visible.
