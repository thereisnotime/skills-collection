# Loki Mode Documentation

**The flagship product of [Autonomi](https://www.autonomi.dev/) -- an autonomous, spec-driven build system with a built-in trust layer. It does not call work done until it is verified: the RARV-C closure loop, 11 quality gates, the completion council, and the verified-completion evidence gate all have to clear before completion is accepted. Provider-agnostic: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cline, and Aider.**

> Spec-driven: turn a spec -- a PRD, GitHub issue, YAML feature file, or any natural-language brief -- into a fully deployed, production-ready application, with verification built in so "done" means verified, not just attempted.

## What is Loki Mode?

Loki Mode is an enterprise-grade autonomous AI development orchestrator that:

- **Built-in trust layer (verified completion)** - Does not call work done until it is verified: the RARV-C closure loop, 11 quality gates, the completion council, and the verified-completion evidence gate all have to clear before completion is accepted
- **Spec-driven development** - Any spec (PRD, GitHub issue, OpenAPI/YAML doc, or one-line brief) drives the build end to end
- **Executes complete SDLC phases** - From requirements to deployment
- **Manages multiple AI agents** - Parallel execution with up to 10+ concurrent agents
- **Provider-agnostic** - runs on Claude Code (Tier 1), Cline (Tier 2), Codex / Aider (Tier 3 degraded); no vendor lock-in. Gemini CLI deprecated v7.5.18; Antigravity CLI coming soon.
- **MCP server** - 34 tools (33 always available; `loki_memory_redact` is gated on `LOKI_MANAGED_AGENTS`/`LOKI_MANAGED_MEMORY`) plus 3 resources and 2 prompts for integration with MCP-aware clients. Launch with `loki mcp`.
- **Learns across projects** - Cross-project memory improves over time
- **Provides enterprise controls** - Authentication, audit logging, sandboxing

## Key Features

### For Individuals & Startups

- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Spec to Production** - Provide a spec (PRD markdown, GitHub issue, YAML brief), Loki handles the rest
- **Provider-Agnostic** - runs on Claude, Cline, Codex, or Aider, no vendor lock-in (Gemini deprecated v7.5.18)
- **LSP Grounding** - First-class agent tools for symbol verification via `mcp/lsp_proxy.py` (v7.7.0+; pyright, typescript-language-server, gopls, rust-analyzer, jdtls; lsp_get_diagnostics regression fully fixed v7.7.14)
- **Cross-Project Learning** - AI improves from every session
- **Dark Dashboard** - Vercel/Linear-inspired dark theme with sidebar navigation (replaces the deprecated VS Code extension as of v7.2.0)

### For Enterprises

- **Token Authentication** - Secure API access with scoped tokens
- **Audit Logging** - Compliance-ready JSONL audit trails
- **Docker Sandbox** - Isolated secure execution environment
- **Project Registry** - Multi-project orchestration
- **Staged Autonomy** - Approval gates for sensitive operations
- **11-Gate Quality System** ([[Quality Gates]]) - Static analysis, 3-reviewer parallel review, anti-sycophancy, severity blocking, coverage gates, mutation detection, Gate 10 backward-compatibility (healing mode, v6.67.0), Gate 11 documentation coverage (v7.5.0), verified-completion evidence gate with inconclusive disclosure (v7.28.0), and held-out spec evals for anti-reward-hacking (v7.28.0)
- **Guided First Build** - `loki quickstart`: four questions to a running build, with the real cost estimate shown before any spend, and a consent-gated Claude Code install offer when no provider is found (v7.29.0)
- **Completion Council** - 3-member voting system with anti-sycophancy checks
- **Security Hardening** - Path traversal, XSS, injection, and memory leak protections
- **TLS/HTTPS Dashboard** - Encrypted API and dashboard connections
- **OIDC/SSO Authentication** - Enterprise identity provider integration
- **RBAC Roles** - Admin, operator, viewer, auditor role model
- **Prometheus Metrics** - OpenMetrics /metrics endpoint for monitoring
- **Branch Protection** - Agent sessions auto-create feature branches with PRs
- **Log Integrity** - SHA-256 chain-hashed tamper-evident audit entries (cross-file chain verification fixed v7.7.15: new `verify_all_logs()` walks rotated daily logs in mtime order; previously verify_log_integrity false-negatived on any file beyond the first-ever)
- **Context Window Tracking** - Real-time gauge, timeline, and per-agent breakdown of context usage
- **Notification Triggers** - Configurable alerts for context thresholds, task failures, budget limits
