# ARS Performance Notes

> **Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.7** with **Max plan** (or equivalent configuration). Opus 4.7 uses adaptive thinking; you no longer set a fixed thinking budget.
>
> The full academic pipeline (10 stages) consumes a **large amount of tokens** — a single end-to-end run can exceed 200K input + 100K output tokens depending on paper length and revision rounds. Budget accordingly.
>
> Individual skills (e.g., `deep-research` alone, or `academic-paper-reviewer` alone) consume significantly less.

## Estimated token usage by mode

| Skill / Mode | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Estimated Cost (Opus 4.7) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deep-research` socratic | ~30K | ~15K | ~$0.60 |
| `deep-research` full | ~60K | ~30K | ~$1.20 |
| `deep-research` systematic-review | ~100K | ~50K | ~$2.00 |
| `academic-paper` plan | ~40K | ~20K | ~$0.80 |
| `academic-paper` full | ~80K | ~50K | ~$1.80 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` full | ~50K | ~30K | ~$1.10 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` quick | ~15K | ~8K | ~$0.30 |
| **Full pipeline (10 stages)** | **~200K+** | **~100K+** | **~$4-6** |
| + Cross-model verification | +~10K (external) | +~5K (external) | +~$0.60-1.10 |

*Estimates based on a ~15,000-word paper with ~60 references. Actual usage varies with paper length, revision rounds, and dialogue depth. Costs at Anthropic API pricing as of April 2026.*

## Recommended Claude Code settings

| Setting | What it does | How to enable | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent Team** | Spawns subagents for parallel research, writing, and review — critical for multi-agent pipelines | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (research preview) | Experimental feature — no stable docs yet |
| **Ralph Loop** | Keeps the session alive during long-running pipeline stages so Claude can work autonomously without timing out | Use `/ralph-loop` to activate | Community plugin — experimental |
| **Skip Permissions** | Bypasses per-tool confirmation prompts, enabling uninterrupted autonomous execution across all pipeline stages | Launch with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | [Permissions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference) · [Advanced Usage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/advanced) |

> **⚠️ Skip Permissions**: This flag disables all tool-use confirmation dialogs. Use at your own discretion — it is convenient for trusted, long-running pipelines but removes the safety net of manual approval. Only enable this in environments where you are comfortable with Claude executing file reads, writes, and shell commands without asking first.
