# 808-DR-STND — Certification Standard

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE

**Authority:** Blueprint 727 § 2 and Epic 10 bead 10.1. This record is the
repository's only definition of a certified marketplace artifact. It preserves
the criteria verbatim; implementation beads may add enforcement, but may not
weaken, reinterpret, or self-declare a certification tier.

## Certification rule

**A-GRADE ⇔ (all of G1–G10) ∧ (all of E1–E6).** Every row terminates in an exit code, a hash comparison, or a filesystem/schema fact. The words _documented_, _reviewed_, _intended_, and _best-practice_ appear in no criterion. The 100-point Freshie score is retained as an **advisory quality hint only** and is explicitly **not** a certification input — 962 A/B artifacts that fail the gate prove why (§ 3.1).

### Gate G — structural prerequisites (any failure ⇒ not A; no partial credit)

### Gate E — evidence (class carried in-band; see § 10)

| #   | Criterion                                                                                     | Minimum class |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| E1  | Deterministic conformance reproducible offline from committed inputs                          | E1            |
| E2  | Committed `eval-spec.yaml`; `j-rig eval` passes under pinned tool + kernel + provider + model | E2            |
| E3  | **Primary `--json` artifact retained and hash-matched to the ledger**                         | E2            |
| E4  | Recorded `baseline_delta`: a deliberately-broken variant of the skill FAILS the same spec     | E3            |
| E5  | Ledger row written by an **independent CI identity**, never the producing agent               | —             |
| E6  | Provenance chain hash-links source → catalog → build → published artifact                     | —             |

## Tier mapping

Certification tier is computed by the validator from observed, passing facts and
is written to Freshie before projection. It is never self-declared.

| Tier   | Name      | Asserts                                                                           | Expected population               |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **T0** | Listed    | parses; frontmatter valid; unicode-clean; not malicious                           | all 3,179                         |
| **T1** | Cataloged | T0 + registry entry + license + provenance resolved + generated artifacts in sync | in-repo + all 63 mirrors          |
| **T2** | Carded    | T1 + `skill-card.yaml` (capabilities, side effects, harness support, limitations) | curated set (~1,881)              |
| **T3** | Evaluated | T2 + `eval-spec.yaml` + a passing evidence bundle referenced by run id            | flagship packs, anything marketed |
| **T4** | Certified | T3 + G1–G10 ∧ E1–E6 + integrity digest + negative fixtures                        | small, deliberate, hand-counted   |

`CERTIFY-PENDING-EVIDENCE` is the honest name for T2-clean artifacts that cannot
yet reach T3/T4. Anything short of the full G1–G10 and E1–E6 conjunction is
never certified.

## Binding behavior

- A failed G or E criterion is `NOT-CERTIFIED`; no quality score offsets a
  legal, safety, provenance, or evidence failure.
- An E2/E3 record whose primary artifact cannot be retrieved and hash-matched
  auto-demotes to E0.
- Rendered strength is the minimum evidence class of a plugin's components;
  aggregation never raises a class.
- A producing identity may not record its own final verdict. E5 is enforced by
  the independent-identity ledger boundary, not a reviewer assertion.

## Certification and waiver authority

This policy is tied to the existing maintainer ladder, live roster, and path
ownership: [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md),
[MAINTAINERS.md](../MAINTAINERS.md), and
[.github/CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS). Their current ownership of
`/000-docs/` and `/freshie/` is the required human authorization boundary for
this standard and its ledger; a GitHub approval is not itself a certification.

1. **Only an independent CI recording identity may certify.** The identity
   that produced an evaluation, authored the artifact, or implemented its
   certification change may never record or sign that artifact's final
   certification verdict. Until the machine-enforced independent-identity
   check exists, the certified population remains zero; an administrator merge
   bypass cannot substitute for it.
2. **A waiver may be authorized only by an active Approver or Maintainer for
   the affected CODEOWNERS area, with Lead final authority for a cross-area
   waiver.** At filing time the active roster and applicable ownership rules
   are resolved from `MAINTAINERS.md` and `.github/CODEOWNERS`; a waiver does
   not grant a role or outlive an owner's active roster entry.
3. **Every waiver is a time-bounded record, not prose.** It must name a stable
   waiver ID, affected artifact and failing criterion, authorizing owner and
   their CODEOWNERS area, written reason, issued-at timestamp, and expiry. An
   absent, malformed, expired, or area-mismatched waiver is invalid and the
   evaluator treats the criterion as failed.

### Never-waivable conditions

The following conditions are never waivable by any role, including the Lead:

- a `REFUSE` finding;
- a security-class error; or
- an unresolved provenance contradiction.

A waiver cannot convert any never-waivable condition into `CERTIFIED`,
`CERTIFY-PENDING-EVIDENCE`, or an advisory pass. It may only be considered for
a non-security, non-provenance criterion where the machine policy explicitly
allows it; it never overrides the full G1–G10/E1–E6 conjunction.

## Change control

Any change to a G or E criterion, tier mapping, or its machine verifier must
update Blueprint 727, this standard, its `STANDARDS.md` authority pointer, and
the corresponding automated check in one reviewable transaction.
