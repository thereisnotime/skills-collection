## What This Release Is

The materialization of the "Use the Printing Press to Learn" plan into shipped code. The plan mapped Matt Van Horn's CLI Printing Press (Go CLI generator with NOI gate, 51 published CLIs, 247 stars) against the Intent Solutions stack and surfaced four real gaps:

1. **Generation capability** — IS had no `/plugin-forge`-equivalent
2. **NOI cultural gate** — plugins shipped without first answering "what does this API really unlock?"
3. **JRig behavioral evaluation integration** — JRig was production-ready at v0.14.0 but not consumable from the consumer-side validation pipeline
4. **Marketplace trust signals** — the catalog had 4× more plugins than the Printing Press but no JRig-Verified badge or forge-generated provenance pill

All four gaps are now operational. The forge workflow is no longer theoretical — `plugins/productivity/plane/` is a Grade A (97/100) plugin produced through all 8 forge gates.

- Two new tags from auto-publish: `@intentsolutionsio/plane@0.1.1`, `@intentsolutionsio/validate-plugin@1.0.1`

### Security

- Secrets scan: PASS (no tracked .env files; no obvious key patterns in last 5 commits)
- Branch protection: validated, temporarily bypassed for release push, restored post-push (with API-payload retry; first attempt hit a GitHub API quirk on the `restrictions: null` field)

## Architectural Changes Worth Knowing

### Validator now has Tier 2 baked in

Previously the 5 production-gate checks lived as bash snippets in `/validate-skillmd`'s SKILL.md — they ran when Claude loaded that skill, not on every validator invocation. Post-#698 the checks are real Python in `validate-skills-schema.py`, running on CI, freshie population, direct script calls, every path. 180 new errors surfaced across the 3,535-skill catalog on first run. Grade distribution unchanged at 68.9% A+B.

### Two-side JRig integration

JRig consumes the spec snapshots (its own copy at `j-rig-skill-binary-eval/references/specs/`) via the new `loadSpecAuthority()` TypeScript API. The IS validator + `/validate-skillmd` consume JRig's existing CLI (`j-rig check`, `j-rig eval`) without asking JRig to grow new flags. Snapshots are versioned; refresh quarterly via PR cadence. Test suite catches divergence between the snapshot files and the embedded TypeScript constants.

### Forge generation pipeline producing real plugins

The 8-gate workflow (NOI → ecosystem → API surface → archetype → compound commands → generation → mandatory `/validate-skillmd --thorough` → PR) is now proven on Plane. The `.forge/` audit trail (research.md, ecosystem.md, proofs.md) ships with every forge plugin so reviewers see how the plugin came to exist. Provenance flags in `plugin.json` (`generated`, `author_type`) trigger the marketplace's "Forge-generated" pill.

### Marketplace trust signal data flow

`j-rig eval --db ~/.../freshie/inventory.sqlite` writes a `tier3-jrig` row to `forge_proofs` → `enrich-jrig-data.mjs` (build step 4) reads via `sqlite3` CLI → writes `marketplace/src/data/jrig-data.json` → plugin detail page overlays onto `plugin.jrig` → "JRig-Verified · N/7 layers" pill renders → click-through to `/plugins/<name>/verification` shows per-layer evidence. End-to-end the badge is real evidence, not a vanity sticker.

## Rollback Procedure

If a regression is discovered:

```bash
# Remove the release
gh release delete v4.31.0 --yes
git push origin --delete v4.31.0
git tag -d v4.31.0

# Revert the release commit (keeps history)
git revert fd62f229e  # the chore(release): prepare v4.31.0 commit
git push origin main

# If individual PRs need reverting, use gh pr revert <PR#>
# Per-plugin tags (@intentsolutionsio/plane@0.1.1 etc.) are independent;
# delete only if the plugin itself is being rolled back.
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **The user's "are we just updating documents?" check was load-bearing.** Mid-session I had shipped many docs and SKILL.md edits but no real code. Calling that out forced the second half of the session to ship actual code (Python validator additions, TS module, schema migrations, build pipeline JOIN). End count: ~1,800 lines of real code. That mid-session inflection was the single most important user intervention.

2. **Branch-protection restore has a GitHub API quirk** with `restrictions: null` on the boilerplate `gh api -F` form — first attempt fails with "For 'allOf/0', 'null' is not an object." Workaround: build the JSON payload via `jq` and pipe through `gh api --input -`. The skill's documented restore sequence should be updated to match.

3. **Vite/Rollup static dependency analysis breaks runtime try/catch fallbacks** — the `/verification` page (#702) initially used `await import(...)` with try/catch to gracefully degrade if `jrig-data.json` was missing. Vite couldn't resolve the dynamic import at build time and CI failed. Fixed by seeding an empty `{}` `jrig-data.json` directly in the PR. Lesson: graceful-degradation patterns that work at runtime don't always work at static-build time. Default to seeded files over try/catch dynamics.

4. **NOI as a hard block is the cultural shift the Printing Press contributes.** Without it `/skill-creator --forge` would produce generic wrappers. With it, the Plane plugin's compound-command set (cycle-velocity, reviewer-gate-strength, priority-drift, etc.) couldn't have been derived — the NOI "team behavior observatory" is what made those questions visible.

5. **"Just do the work, don't present menus" is a real productivity multiplier** when the user has approved the broader plan. After explicit autonomous-CTO approval, dropping the option-menu pattern and just executing each phase saved hours.
