- **Status:** Implementation complete; Bead closure follows successful filing of this AAR

## Outcome

The tracked stale catalog backup was removed and the existing catalog invariant now proves that
Git tracks exactly the two root catalog paths governed by `STANDARDS.md`. It rejects any additional
`marketplace*.json*` shadow and fails closed when either canonical catalog is missing or Git cannot
enumerate the tracked inventory.

## Before and after

| Measure                           | Before |     After |
| --------------------------------- | -----: | --------: |
| Tracked root catalog-shaped files |      3 |         2 |
| Tracked catalog shadows           |      1 |         0 |
| Canonical catalog entries         |    471 |       471 |
| Stale backup entries              |    234 |   removed |
| Targeted regression tests         |      0 | 5 passing |

The deleted backup's blob was `c9bb532a6c5a28d162f718961a05c1041090dbe2`.

## Verification evidence

- `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_validate_catalog_invariants.py` — `5 passed`.
- `python3 scripts/validate-catalog-invariants.py` —
  `Catalog invariant check passed (471 plugins).`
- Independent clean-checkout review planted its own shadow variants and exercised empty inventory,
  `git ls-files` failure, and process `OSError`; every failure was visible and non-zero.
- `pnpm run sync-marketplace` and the generated-artifact check produced no tracked drift.
- Ruff, Prettier, lint, typecheck, `git diff --check`, MiniMax Review, MiniMax Adversarial Review,
  `ci-required`, `gitleaks`, and `skill-conform` passed at the reviewed head.
- The complete PR diff touched only the deleted backup, validator, regression test, and
  `CHANGELOG.md`. No mirrored content changed.
- The index header's prior 169-file snapshot came from `aff01bf72d`. Documents 730–735 were
  subsequently filed and already indexed; this filing adds document 736. A tracked-path versus
  index-link comparison now reports 176/176 with zero missing or untracked links.

## Review and merge topology

The independent clean-checkout reviewer returned
[**PASS**](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/1196#issuecomment-5305233075).
Branch protection requires one approval, but no genuine independent second GitHub identity was
available to submit it. Platform owner Jeremy explicitly authorized an administrator bypass for PR
#1196 after all executable and independent-review gates passed. The bypass was disclosed in the PR
record; no branch rule or required status context was changed. This is a temporary review-topology
compromise, not a substitute for the independent identity and machine-enforced no-self-approval work
governed by Epic 10. The owner authorization is also stored in the authoritative `claude-hz8f.1` Bead
and cross-linked to the
[PR disclosure](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/1196#issuecomment-5305161057).

## Scope and rollback

No registry, credential, contributor, Plane, branch-protection, package publication, or production
mutation occurred. Duplicate catalog-entry remediation and every other Epic 1 bead remained out of
scope. Rollback is `git revert -m 1 94e84d4c989fb1b9e214a6df2e00225bde557b92`, followed by the targeted
test and live validator; that intentionally restores the prior backup and removes the gate.

## Lessons and next gate

An absence claim is only valid when the inventory source is itself proven complete. Treating an
empty successful Git query as “no shadows” would have left the source-of-truth boundary fail-open.
Administrator bypass is an explicit owner exception while the review-topology control gap remains,
not the accepted steady state. The next Epic 1 slice must be activated separately in Beads/Dolt after
this bead closes.
