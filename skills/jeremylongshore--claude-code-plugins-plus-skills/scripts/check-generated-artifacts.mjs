/**
 * check-generated-artifacts.mjs — assert that deterministically-regenerated
 * projections are NOT tracked in git.
 *
 * A generated file that is also committed has two claimants to one fact: the
 * generator and the tree. They diverge silently, because nothing compares them —
 * exactly how `marketplace/public/data/*.json` came to duplicate ~28.5 MB of
 * `marketplace/src/data/*.json` byte-for-byte (identical blob SHAs), and how the
 * kobiton binary reached `skills/.curated/` (bead claude-5awj.2 / .1).
 *
 * This gate is the RECURRENCE PREVENTION for that class: re-adding such a file
 * fails CI with the regeneration command in the message. It deliberately checks
 * TRACKING, not content — content equality is the generator's job, and a gate
 * that regenerated to compare would be slow and would mask a broken generator.
 *
 * Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = a projection is tracked (each one named).
