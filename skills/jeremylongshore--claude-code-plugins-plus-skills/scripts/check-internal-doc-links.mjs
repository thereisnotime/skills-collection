/**
 * check-internal-doc-links.mjs — fail the build when a first-party doc links to
 * a file that does not exist.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN JUST GATING check-links.yml
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * The repo already runs lychee on every markdown PR, and it has been finding
 * these every week — 500 errors on the last completed run. Both lychee
 * invocations are configured `fail: false`, so the job reports success
 * regardless, and 391 of those 500 were dead links to paths inside this repo.
 *
 * Simply flipping lychee to `fail: true` does not work, and the config comment
 * says why: rate limits and TLS resets produced ~200 false failures. That is the
 * nature of network checking — it is NON-DETERMINISTIC, so it cannot be a
 * required check without flaking the merge queue.
 *
 * This script gates the half that IS deterministic: links to paths inside the
 * repo. No network, no rate limits, no flakes — the same input always gives the
 * same answer, which is the only kind of check that belongs in `ci-required`.
 * External link rot stays with the weekly lychee report, where a false positive
 * costs a glance instead of a blocked merge.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED
 * --------------------------------
 * Of the 391 file-not-found errors, only a small minority are defects in our
 * own docs. Counting the rest would make the gate a liar:
 *
 *   - External mirror plugins (their dir carries `.source.json`). These links
 *     are correct in the contributor's own repo and broken only in our mirror.
 *     CLAUDE.md's never-clobber rule forbids editing them, and the next sync
 *     would revert us anyway. Upstreaming is the only correct route, so a gate
 *     demanding a local fix would demand a rule violation.
 *   - `skills/.curated/**` — a GENERATED mirror of the best plugin skills. The
 *     plugin skill is the source of truth; editing the mirror is wrong and
 *     `promote-curated-check` already guards the pairing.
 *   - `tests/fixtures/**` — deliberately arbitrary content, already excluded in
 *     `.lychee.toml`.
 *   - Anything inside a fenced code block. `](url)`, `](path)` and
 *     `](references/file.md)` in a usage example are illustrations, not links.
 *     Counting them would train authors to contort their examples.
 *
 * RATCHETING, NOT ZERO
 * --------------------
 * Same contract as scripts/lint-design-tokens.mjs: the count may fall, never
 * rise, and the script REFUSES to raise its own baseline. A zero baseline would
 * be dishonest today (a handful of genuinely-missing docs remain, which is a
 * content gap rather than a path typo) and would tempt whoever hits it into
 * excluding a whole directory to get green.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-internal-doc-links.mjs [--list]

/**
 * Maximum tolerated count. Lower this when links are fixed; the script will not
 * raise it for you.
 *
 * The 1 is a known, single defect, named here so nobody has to re-derive it:
 *
 *   plugins/saas-packs/clerk-pack/skills/clerk-core-workflow-b/references/
 *     session-middleware-deep-dive.md:279
 *   links to `references/session-middleware-deep-dive.md` — i.e. to ITSELF, from
 *   inside itself, so it resolves to references/references/... It is a stray copy
 *   of the pointer in the parent SKILL.md:52 (which is correct).
 *
 * Not fixed in the same change that introduced this gate because that file is a
 * PROMOTED source: `skills/.curated/clerk-core-workflow-b/references/...` is a
 * byte-identical generated mirror of it, and `promote-curated-check` fails a PR
 * that edits a promoted source without regenerating. Editing pack prose plus
 * syncing the curated mirror deserves its own review rather than riding along in
 * a CI-gate change. Lower this to 0 when that lands.
