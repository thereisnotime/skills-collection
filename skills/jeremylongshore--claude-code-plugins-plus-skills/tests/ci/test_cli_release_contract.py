"""Regression checks for the ccpi CLI test and release workflows.

Two defects shaped these checks. The CLI's filtered install also installs the
repository root's devDependencies, so every CLI job natively built
better-sqlite3 for @intentsolutions/jrig-cli, which the CLI never loads; on
Windows that needed a pinned node-gyp while the runner used Node 20. And the
publish job ran a bare ``npm publish``, so a pre-release tag such as
cli-v3.1.0-beta.1 would have become the ``latest`` dist-tag for every user.
