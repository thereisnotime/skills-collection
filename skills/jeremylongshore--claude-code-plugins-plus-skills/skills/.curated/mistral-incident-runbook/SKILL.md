# Mistral AI Incident Runbook

## Overview

Rapid incident response procedures for Mistral AI integration failures. Covers severity classification, quick triage script, decision tree, per-error mitigations, communication templates, and postmortem process.

## Prerequisites

- An assigned incident commander and a documented application severity policy
- Read-only access to application telemetry, deployment state, and redacted logs
- A configured `MISTRAL_API_KEY` supplied through the environment or secret manager
- Authorization to apply the named rollback, fallback, or concurrency change
- A secure incident workspace for evidence and stakeholder updates

## Instructions

1. Use `Read` and `Grep` on approved logs and configuration to establish impact,
   start time, endpoint, model, HTTP status, and request IDs without copying prompts,
   credentials, or customer content.
2. Assign severity from observed user impact, not from the provider status page alone.
3. Run the minimal redacted probe, follow the matching immediate-action branch, and
   prefer a reversible mitigation over an untested production change.
4. Verify both the provider probe and the affected application path. Keep the incident
   open through the service's normal observation window.
5. Produce the output contract below and follow the retained-evidence checklist in
   [operator-checklist.md](references/operator-checklist.md).

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Example |
|-------|------------|---------------|---------|
| P1 | Complete outage | < 15 min | All Mistral requests failing |
| P2 | Degraded service | < 1 hour | High latency, partial 429s |
| P3 | Minor impact | < 4 hours | Occasional errors, non-critical feature |
| P4 | No user impact | Next business day | Monitoring gaps, docs |

## Quick Triage Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
echo "=== Mistral AI Quick Triage ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

# 1. API health
echo -e "\n1. Mistral API status:"
HTTP=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MISTRAL_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models 2>/dev/null)
echo "   HTTP: $HTTP"
case $HTTP in
  200) echo "   OK — API is reachable" ;;
  401) echo "   AUTH FAILURE — API key invalid or revoked" ;;
  429) echo "   RATE LIMITED — check workspace limits" ;;
  5*) echo "   SERVER ERROR — Mistral service issue" ;;
  000) echo "   NETWORK ERROR — cannot reach api.mistral.ai" ;;
esac

# 2. Our service health
echo -e "\n2. App health endpoint:"
curl -sf https://yourapp.com/health 2>/dev/null | jq '.services.mistral' || echo "   UNREACHABLE"

# 3. Error rate (if Prometheus available)
echo -e "\n3. Error rate (last 5m):"
curl -sf "localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(mistral_errors_total[5m])" 2>/dev/null \
  | jq -r '.data.result[] | "\(.metric.model): \(.value[1])/s"' || echo "   Prometheus unavailable"
```

## Decision Tree

```
API returning errors?
|-- YES: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models
|   |-- 401 → API key issue (Step 1 below)
|   |-- 429 → Rate limited (Step 2 below)
|   |-- 5xx → Mistral service issue (Step 3 below)
|   +-- Timeout → Network issue (Step 4 below)
+-- NO: Our service returning errors?
    |-- YES → Check app logs and config
    +-- NO → Resolved, continue monitoring
```

## Immediate Actions

### Step 1: 401 — Authentication Failure (P1)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Verify presence without printing key material or key metadata
test -n "${MISTRAL_API_KEY:-}" || {
  echo "MISTRAL_API_KEY is not set" >&2
  exit 1
}

# Test directly; emit only the HTTP status, never verbose request headers
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MISTRAL_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models

# If invalid: rotate key at console.mistral.ai
# Then update in your secret manager:
# GCP: gcloud secrets versions add mistral-api-key --data-file=-
# AWS: aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id mistral/api-key
# K8s: kubectl create secret generic mistral --from-literal=api-key="$NEW_KEY" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Step 2: 429 — Rate Limited (P2)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Check headers for limit info
curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MISTRAL_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models | grep -i "ratelimit\|retry-after"

# Immediate mitigation: reduce concurrency
kubectl set env deployment/app MAX_CONCURRENT_MISTRAL=3

# Check workspace limits: https://admin.mistral.ai/plateforme/limits
# Long-term: Contact Mistral to increase limits
```

### Step 3: 5xx — Mistral Service Error (P1/P2)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Check Mistral status page
echo "Check: https://status.mistral.ai/"

# Enable fallback/degradation
kubectl set env deployment/app MISTRAL_FALLBACK=true

# Monitor recovery (check every 30s)
watch -n 30 'curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MISTRAL_API_KEY}" \
  https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models'
```

### Step 4: Network/Timeout Error (P2)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Test DNS
nslookup api.mistral.ai

# Test connectivity
curl -v --connect-timeout 5 https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models

# Check egress policies
kubectl get networkpolicy -A | grep mistral

# Temporary two-minute timeout while the network cause is investigated.
# Revert after recovery; this does not fix upstream latency.
kubectl set env deployment/app MISTRAL_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
```

## Output

- Issue identified and severity classified
- Mitigation applied per error type
- Stakeholders notified with status updates
- Evidence collected for postmortem
- Action items documented

The report must also name the incident commander, UTC observation window, rollback or
fallback state, unresolved risks, and next update time. Mark the incident `RESOLVED`
only after the affected application path—not just the provider probe—meets its normal
health threshold through that window.

## Examples

### Provider-side degradation

The provider probe returns intermittent `503` responses, the status page reports an
active incident, and application error rate crosses the P2 threshold. Enable the
pre-approved fallback, cap retries to prevent amplification, post the external
degradation notice, and keep monitoring the primary path. Resolve only after the
primary path is healthy for the service's observation window and the fallback has
been safely reverted.

### Credential failure isolated to one environment

Production returns `401` while staging succeeds and the provider status page is clear.
Classify the event as an internal credential incident. Compare secret version metadata
without exposing values, rotate the production credential through the secret manager,
restart only affected consumers, and verify the application path. Record who approved
the rotation and when the superseded secret was revoked.
