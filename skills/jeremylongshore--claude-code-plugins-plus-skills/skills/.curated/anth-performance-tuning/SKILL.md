# Anthropic Performance Tuning

## Overview

Optimize Claude API latency and throughput via prompt caching, model selection, streaming, and request optimization. The biggest wins come from prompt caching (90% input cost reduction) and model selection (Haiku is 4x faster than Sonnet).

## Prompt Caching (Biggest Win)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Mark long, reusable content with cache_control
# Cached content: 90% cheaper on subsequent requests, near-zero latency for cached portion
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system=[
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "You are an expert on the following 50-page document: ...<long document>...",
            "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # Cache this block
        }
    ],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What does section 3.2 say?"}]
)

# Check cache performance
print(f"Cache read tokens: {message.usage.cache_read_input_tokens}")   # Free/cheap
print(f"Cache creation tokens: {message.usage.cache_creation_input_tokens}")  # First call only
print(f"Uncached input tokens: {message.usage.input_tokens}")
```

**Cache requirements:** Minimum 1,024 tokens for Sonnet/Opus, 2,048 for Haiku. Cache lives for 5 minutes (refreshed on each hit).

## Model Selection for Speed

| Model | Speed | Cost (per MTok in/out) | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------------------|----------|
| Claude Haiku | Fastest | $0.80 / $4.00 | Classification, extraction, routing |
| Claude Sonnet | Balanced | $3.00 / $15.00 | General tasks, tool use, code |
| Claude Opus | Deepest | $15.00 / $75.00 | Complex reasoning, research |

```python
# Route by task complexity
def select_model(task_type: str) -> str:
    routing = {
        "classify": "claude-haiku-4-20250514",
        "extract": "claude-haiku-4-20250514",
        "summarize": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "code": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "research": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
    }
    return routing.get(task_type, "claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
```

## Streaming for Perceived Speed

```python
# Streaming reduces time-to-first-token from seconds to ~200ms
with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=2048,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        yield text  # User sees response immediately
```

## Reduce Token Count

```python
# 1. Set max_tokens to what you actually need (not max)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-haiku-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=128,  # Not 4096 — smaller = faster generation
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Classify as positive/negative: 'Great product!'"}]
)

# 2. Use prefill to skip preamble
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=64,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Classify sentiment: 'Great product!'"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sentiment:"}  # Skip "Sure, I'd be happy to..."
    ]
)

# 3. Pre-check token count for large inputs
count = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": large_document}]
)
if count.input_tokens > 100_000:
    # Chunk or summarize first
    pass
```

## Parallel Requests

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import PQueue from 'p-queue';

const client = new Anthropic();
const queue = new PQueue({ concurrency: 10 });

// Process multiple prompts in parallel (within rate limits)
const results = await Promise.all(
  prompts.map(p => queue.add(() =>
    client.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-haiku-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 256,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: p }],
    })
  ))
);
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Optimization | Latency Impact | Cost Impact |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Prompt caching | -50% (cached portion) | -90% input cost |
| Haiku over Sonnet | -75% TTFT | -73% cost |
| Streaming | -80% TTFT (perceived) | Same cost |
| Lower max_tokens | -10-30% total time | Same cost |
| Prefill technique | -20% output tokens | Proportional savings |

## Prerequisites

- Define latency, throughput, quality, token, and error SLOs plus the owner-approved model, cache, concurrency, and retry policy.
- Use pinned model IDs, synthetic prompts, an isolated workspace, and representative non-sensitive fixtures; do not benchmark with customer content or production credentials.
- Configure aggregate-only telemetry, bounded concurrency, rate-limit awareness, and a tested rollback configuration.

## Instructions

1. Establish a baseline for time-to-first-token, completion latency, tokens, cache hit rate, throughput, quality, and errors using repeated synthetic runs.
2. Change one lever at a time: model, prompt/cache layout, token budget, streaming, batching, or concurrency. Keep prompt content out of logs and verify cache eligibility for sensitive data before enabling it.
3. Enforce request scope, `max_tokens`, timeout, retry, and concurrency limits. Stop the run when rate limits, quality, or data-policy checks fail rather than increasing access or disabling controls.
4. Canary the selected configuration in a sandbox or internal workspace, compare against baseline, and obtain approval before production rollout. Monitor p95/p99 latency, error rate, token use, and spend.
5. Restore the prior configuration on regression, invalidate temporary cache/test artifacts according to retention policy, and retain a redacted benchmark receipt.

## Output

Produce a performance receipt containing configuration and model IDs, benchmark fixture class, sample size, latency/throughput/token/cache aggregates, quality and error outcomes, workspace/canary scope, approval, retention, and rollback reference. Exclude prompts, responses, user identifiers, and secrets.

## Error Handling

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Rate limit or queue saturation | Reduce bounded concurrency, honor retry guidance, and stop the canary if the SLO remains breached. |
| Quality falls after model/token change | Restore the baseline configuration and quarantine the comparison until reviewed. |
| Cache miss or policy-ineligible content | Disable caching for that path and use the approved uncached flow. |
| Timeout or streaming disconnect | Apply bounded retry/idempotency handling, return a safe partial-state result, and investigate without logging content. |

## Examples

Benchmark 500 synthetic `fixture-prompt-*` requests in a staging workspace with Haiku and the current route, assert `content_logged=0`, `p99_latency<approved_limit`, and `quality=pass`, then canary the winner to internal traffic. If p99 or error thresholds fail, emit `canary=halted; rollback=perf-baseline`.
