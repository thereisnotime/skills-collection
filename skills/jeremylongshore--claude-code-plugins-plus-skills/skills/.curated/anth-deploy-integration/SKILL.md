# Anthropic Deploy Integration

## Overview

Deploy Claude API integrations with proper secret management, health checks, and rollback procedures across Docker, GCP Cloud Run, and Kubernetes.

## Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY src/ ./src/
ENV ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

```python
# src/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import anthropic

app = FastAPI()
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    try:
        count = client.messages.count_tokens(
            model="claude-haiku-4-20250514",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "ping"}]
        )
        return {"status": "healthy", "api": "connected"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(503, detail=str(e))
```

## GCP Cloud Run

```bash
echo -n "sk-ant-api03-..." | gcloud secrets create anthropic-key --data-file=-

gcloud run deploy claude-service \
  --image gcr.io/my-project/claude-service \
  --set-secrets ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=anthropic-key:latest \
  --min-instances 1 --max-instances 10 \
  --memory 512Mi --timeout 120s
```

## Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: { name: claude-service }
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy: { type: RollingUpdate, rollingUpdate: { maxUnavailable: 1 } }
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          env:
            - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef: { name: anthropic-secrets, key: api-key }
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /health, port: 8000 }
            periodSeconds: 30
```

## Rollback

```bash
# Cloud Run
gcloud run services update-traffic claude-service --to-revisions=PREVIOUS=100

# Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/claude-service
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Container crash on start | Missing API key env var | Verify secret binding |
| Health check fails | Key invalid in prod | Test key with curl |
| 429 after scaling up | More replicas = more RPM | Shared rate limiter (Redis) |

## Prerequisites

- Have an approved artifact digest, environment/workspace mapping, secret-manager reference, health probe, deployment owner, canary plan, and tested rollback command.
- Use a least-privileged runtime identity and synthetic fixtures in staging; never embed API keys in images, manifests, command history, or deployment output.
- Define deployment SLOs for health, errors, latency, rate limits, cost, and data-policy checks, with explicit halt thresholds.

## Instructions

1. Build and scan the pinned artifact, bind the environment-specific secret at runtime, and verify that logs and probes cannot expose prompts, responses, or credentials.
2. Deploy to staging and run the token-count/health probe plus synthetic Messages API, error, timeout, rate-limit, and redaction tests. Confirm the workspace and model are approved.
3. Release to one sandbox or internal canary, monitor aggregate SLOs and `sensitive_content_logged=0`, and require owner approval before wider traffic.
4. Promote in bounded stages while preserving the prior revision and idempotent deployment record. Do not bypass failed health, authorization, or data-policy gates.
5. On failure, stop traffic, roll back to the prior revision, revoke temporary access, clean up staged artifacts under the retention policy, and issue a redacted deployment receipt.

## Output

Produce a deployment receipt containing artifact digest, environment/workspace class, model policy, probe/test results, canary scope, SLO outcomes, approval, rollout state, retention cleanup, and rollback reference. Exclude API keys, prompts, responses, customer identifiers, and raw stack traces.

## Examples

Deploy `artifact=sha256:fixture` to a staging workspace, run synthetic `fixture-request-001`, assert `workspace=staging; sensitive_content_logged=0`, then release a 1% internal canary. If the 5xx or latency gate fails, record `promotion=halted; rollback=previous-revision` and send no production traffic.
