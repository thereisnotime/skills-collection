# CoreWeave Incident Runbook

## Overview

Respond to GPU workload incidents by stabilizing customer impact, preserving
redacted evidence, and restoring a known-good state. The incident commander owns
communications and escalation; responders use only the access required for triage.

## Prerequisites

- An incident ID, named commander, affected namespace/service, and on-call route.
- Authorized read-only cluster access plus a documented production rollback revision.
- A redaction policy for logs, prompts, model artifacts, and credentials.

## Instructions

1. Declare severity and scope, then capture pod, event, node, and service status.
2. Stabilize impact with the documented scale, failover, or rollback action before root-cause work.
3. Collect only redacted, bounded diagnostics and escalate hardware or capacity issues through CoreWeave support.
4. Verify recovery against the service SLO, update stakeholders, and create follow-up work for root cause and prevention.

## Triage Steps

```bash
# 1. Check pod status
kubectl get pods -l app=inference -o wide

# 2. Check recent events
kubectl get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -20

# 3. Check node status
kubectl get nodes -l gpu.nvidia.com/class -o wide

# 4. Check GPU health
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=inference -o name | head -1) -- nvidia-smi
```

## Common Incidents

### Inference Service Down

1. Check pod status and events
2. If OOMKilled: reduce batch size or upgrade GPU
3. If ImagePullBackOff: check registry credentials
4. If Pending: check GPU quota and availability

### GPU Node Failure

1. Pods will be rescheduled automatically
2. If no capacity: scale down non-critical workloads
3. Contact CoreWeave support for extended outages

### Model Loading Failure

1. Check HuggingFace token secret exists
2. Verify model name spelling
3. Check PVC has sufficient storage
4. Review container logs for download errors

## Rollback

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/inference
```

## Output

- A time-stamped incident record with scope, owner, stabilization action, and redacted evidence.
- A verified recovery or an explicit escalation with a safe customer-impact mitigation.

## Error Handling

| Incident complication | Required response |
|---|---|
| Rollback fails | Stop repeated deploy attempts, escalate to the platform owner, and preserve events. |
| Diagnostics include a secret | Restrict distribution, rotate the secret, and recollect redacted evidence. |
| No GPU capacity is available | Prioritize critical services under approved policy; do not remove tenant quotas. |
| Recovery cannot meet SLO | Declare the continuing impact and use the approved fallback or communication path. |

## Examples

For a failing production rollout, stabilize first and capture only the relevant evidence:

```bash
kubectl -n inference-prod rollout undo deployment/inference
kubectl -n inference-prod rollout status deployment/inference --timeout=10m
kubectl -n inference-prod get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -30
```

Record the revision, outcome, and redacted events in the incident. Do not retry a broken image or expose a troubleshooting endpoint publicly.
