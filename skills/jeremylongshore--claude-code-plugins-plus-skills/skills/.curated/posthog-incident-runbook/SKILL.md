# PostHog Incident Runbook

## Overview

Rapid incident response for PostHog integration failures. PostHog Cloud has its own status page (status.posthog.com) — the first step is always determining whether the issue is PostHog-side or your integration.

## Prerequisites

- The affected service, deployment window, and PostHog region are known.
- Read-only evidence is preferred; production write probes require explicit authorization.
- A safe application fallback exists for analytics and flag failures.

## Instructions

### Tool discipline

Use `Read` to inspect the relevant configuration and implementation before proposing changes. Use `Grep` to locate initialization, capture, flag, and credential boundaries.

Follow the triage sequence below. Stop when evidence identifies a failed boundary; do not continue mutating unrelated layers.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------|
| P1 | Analytics completely down | < 15 min | All capture calls failing, feature flags returning defaults |
| P2 | Degraded analytics | < 1 hour | High latency, partial event loss, slow flag eval |
| P3 | Minor impact | < 4 hours | Webhook delays, specific event type missing |
| P4 | No user impact | Next day | Monitoring gaps, dashboard stale data |

## Quick Triage (Run First)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${POSTHOG_PUBLIC_HOST:?Set the US or EU ingestion host for this project}"
: "${POSTHOG_PRIVATE_HOST:?Set the matching US or EU private API host}"

# 1. Check PostHog's status page and the selected regional ingestion host.
curl -fsSI https://status.posthog.com/ | head -n 1
curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "Regional health: %{http_code}\n" \
  "$POSTHOG_PUBLIC_HOST/healthz"

# 2. Verify private API access without changing project data.
if [ -n "${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "Private API: %{http_code}\n" \
    "$POSTHOG_PRIVATE_HOST/api/projects/" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY"
fi

# 3. Check the application's own health and recent delivery telemetry.
curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "Application health: %{http_code}\n" \
  "${APPLICATION_HEALTH_URL:?Set the affected service health URL}"
```

Do not use an event capture as the default health check: it writes project data, and an HTTP 200 only confirms receipt and payload shape, not successful ingestion. If the incident commander explicitly authorizes a production write probe, use a named synthetic event and distinct ID, record the approval and timestamp, inspect `quota_limited`, and remove or exclude the probe from analysis.

## Decision Tree

```
Is PostHog Cloud healthy (status.posthog.com)?
├── NO → PostHog outage
│   ├── Enable graceful degradation (feature flags return defaults)
│   ├── Monitor status.posthog.com for resolution
│   └── Events will be lost during outage (capture is fire-and-forget)
│
└── YES → Our integration issue
    ├── Are we getting 401? → API key issue (see Error 401 below)
    ├── Are we getting 429? → Rate limited (see Error 429 below)
    ├── Are events just not appearing? → Check flush/shutdown (see below)
    └── Are flags returning defaults? → Check the feature flags secure API key (see below)
```

## Immediate Actions by Error Type

### 401/403 — Authentication Failed

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Test the public project token through flag evaluation; this does not capture an event.
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Flags: %{http_code}\n" -X POST "$POSTHOG_PUBLIC_HOST/flags/?v=2" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"api_key\":\"$NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY\",\"distinct_id\":\"incident-readonly-probe\"}"

# Test the private credential with a read-only project list.
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Private API: %{http_code}\n" "$POSTHOG_PRIVATE_HOST/api/projects/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY"

# Fix: If key is invalid, rotate in PostHog dashboard and update secrets
```

### 429 — Rate Limited

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# PostHog rate limits (private API only):
# - Analytics endpoints: 240/min, 1200/hour
# - HogQL query: 2400/hour
# - Local flag eval polling: 600/min
# - Other private CRUD endpoints: 480/min, 4800/hour
# - Capture endpoints: NO LIMIT

# Immediate: Cache API responses, reduce polling frequency
# Long-term: See posthog-rate-limits skill
```

### Events Not Appearing

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Most common cause: not calling flush/shutdown in serverless

# Check 1: verify the regional host and inspect SDK delivery logs, queue depth,
# ingestion warnings, and the latest expected event in PostHog.

# Check 2: verify the API host is correct (common mistake).
# WRONG: https://app.posthog.com (this is the UI)
# RIGHT: the target project's US or EU ingestion endpoint
```

### Feature Flags Returning Defaults

```typescript
// Most common causes:
// 1. No feature flags secure API key → local definitions are unavailable
// 2. Flags not loaded yet → check timing
// 3. Wrong project key → flags from different project

// Fix 1: Pass the server-only feature flags secure API key via the SDK option
const posthog = new PostHog(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
  personalApiKey: process.env.POSTHOG_FEATURE_FLAGS_SECURE_API_KEY,
});

// Fix 2: Wait for flags in browser
posthog.onFeatureFlags(() => {
  // Now flags are loaded
  const value = posthog.isFeatureEnabled('my-flag');
});
```

## Graceful Degradation Pattern

```typescript
// PostHog should NEVER crash your app
function safeCapture(distinctId: string, event: string, props?: Record<string, any>) {
  try {
    posthog.capture({ distinctId, event, properties: props });
  } catch {
    // Swallow error — analytics failure should never impact users
  }
}

async function safeFlag(key: string, userId: string, fallback: boolean = false): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const result = await posthog.isFeatureEnabled(key, userId);
    return result ?? fallback;
  } catch {
    return fallback; // Return safe default
  }
}
```

## Post-Incident Evidence Collection

```bash
set -euo pipefail
INCIDENT_DIR="posthog-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$INCIDENT_DIR"

# Collect diagnostics
echo "Incident: $(date -u)" > "$INCIDENT_DIR/timeline.txt"
curl -s https://us.i.posthog.com/healthz > "$INCIDENT_DIR/healthz.json" 2>&1
env | grep -i posthog | sed 's/=.*/=***/' > "$INCIDENT_DIR/env-redacted.txt"
npm list posthog-js posthog-node 2>/dev/null > "$INCIDENT_DIR/versions.txt"

tar -czf "$INCIDENT_DIR.tar.gz" "$INCIDENT_DIR"
echo "Evidence collected: $INCIDENT_DIR.tar.gz"
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Complete analytics outage | PostHog Cloud down | Enable graceful degradation, monitor status page |
| Partial event loss | Serverless not flushing | Add `await posthog.shutdown()` |
| All flags return false | Secure flag key missing or expired | Add or rotate the feature flags secure API key |
| Admin API 401 | Personal key revoked | Generate new key in PostHog settings |
| High latency | Network path to PostHog | Check reverse proxy, try direct connection |

## Output

- Triage commands identifying issue source
- Immediate remediation for each error type
- Graceful degradation wrappers
- Post-incident evidence bundle

## Examples

For a sudden feature-flag fallback spike, first confirm application health, PostHog status, region routing, and SDK initialization lifetime. Avoid sending probe events into production until authorized; use a controlled test project when a write probe is necessary, then record containment, rollback, and recovery evidence.
