# Algolia Security Baseline

## Overview

This skill reviews the actual security boundary of an Algolia integration. A browser search-only key is intentionally visible, so record contents, index restrictions, secured-key design, and abuse controls remain essential.

## Prerequisites

- A named repository, environment, and Algolia application or index in scope
- The local lockfile and installed client types as implementation authority
- A safe read-only query or explicitly disposable test target
- Current first-party documentation for any provider behavior that affects the change

## Tool Discipline

Use `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep` to inspect local code, configuration names, tests, and dependency versions. Use `WebFetch` only for current official Algolia documentation. Use `Write` or `Edit` only after identifying the target files, constraints, and verification plan.

## Current Contract

- Never index data that must remain secret merely because an attribute is not displayed.
- Use custom main keys with minimum ACLs and restrictions; rotate long-lived keys under an owned policy.
- Generate secured keys on a trusted backend and require restrictions appropriate to the user or tenant.
- Treat referer restrictions, rate limits, filters, and ACLs as layers whose current behavior must be verified.

## Authentication

Inspect key metadata without exporting secret values. Admin credentials stay out of application defaults, browser bundles, logs, support artifacts, and developer examples.

## Instructions

1. Inventory every application ID, environment variable, client constructor, key owner, ACL, restriction, and exposed index.
2. Scan source, built assets, history, logs, and documentation for write-capable key exposure.
3. Review record fields and index settings for data a search-only client could retrieve or scrape.
4. Map backend operations to custom key ACLs and tenant search to secured-key restrictions.
5. Test allowed and denied paths, including cross-index and cross-tenant attempts.
6. Document rotation, revocation, incident response, ownership, exceptions, and retest dates.

## Approval Boundaries

Do not rotate or revoke production keys, alter index restrictions, or remove access until dependencies and recovery paths are verified.

## Output

Return the key and actor inventory, exposure findings, data-visibility review, allowed/denied tests, remediation plan, rotation procedure, and residual risks.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Response |
|---|---|
| Write key found in browser | Contain and rotate through the incident process. |
| Search key exposes sensitive records | Remove the data and review index design. |
| Tenant restriction bypassed | Disable affected path and correct server-generated restrictions. |
| Key owner unknown | Treat it as orphaned and investigate before revocation. |

## Examples

Use this compact input and expected handoff to calibrate scope and evidence quality.

Input:

```text
app=APP…9X; actors=browser,indexer,ops; indices=products_*
```

Expected handoff:

```text
browser=search-only; indexer=custom-minimum; tenant-denial=pass; exposed-write-key=none
```
