# Supabase Schema from Requirements

## Overview

Translate business requirements into a production-ready Postgres schema inside Supabase, covering the full path from specification to applied migration: entity extraction, tables with proper types and constraints, Row Level Security policies, performance indexes, timestamp triggers, and TypeScript type generation. Getting this right early matters because every downstream feature — auth, storage, realtime, edge functions — depends on well-designed tables.

## Prerequisites

- Supabase CLI installed (`npm install -g supabase`) and project linked (`supabase link`)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` v2+ installed in the project
- Business requirements, PRD, or specification document identifying entities and access rules
- Local Supabase running (`supabase start`) or a linked remote project

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Requirements and Create Migration

Read the requirements document and extract entities, attributes, relationships, and access control rules. Map each entity to a Postgres table.

**Entity extraction example** (project management app):

| Entity | Key Columns | Relationships |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Organization | name, slug, plan | has many Projects, has many Members |
| Project | name, description, status | belongs to Organization, has many Tasks |
| Task | title, priority, status, due_date | belongs to Project, assigned to User |
| Member | role (owner/admin/member) | junction linking User to Organization |

Create the migration file:

```bash
npx supabase migration new create_tables
# Creates: supabase/migrations/TIMESTAMP_create_tables.sql
```

Write the migration SQL using standard Postgres data types (`uuid`, `text`, `integer`, `boolean`, `timestamptz`, `jsonb`):
Full worked migration (project-management app — tables, FKs, indexes, `moddatetime` triggers): [references/worked-schema-examples.md](references/worked-schema-examples.md).

**Data type selection guide:**

| Use case | Type | Notes |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- |
| Primary keys | `uuid` | Always with `uuid_generate_v4()` default |
| Names, titles | `text` | Prefer over `varchar` in Postgres |
| Counts, ranks | `integer` | Use `bigint` for sequences |
| Flags | `boolean` | Default explicitly to `true` or `false` |
| Timestamps | `timestamptz` | Never use `timestamp` without timezone |
| Flexible data | `jsonb` | Queryable JSON; use for settings, metadata |
| Lists | `text[]` | Postgres arrays for simple tags or labels |

### Step 2: Add Row Level Security Policies

Every table exposed to the client must have RLS enabled. Write reusable `security
definer` helper functions first, then write per-table policies that call them. The
skeleton for one table:

```sql
alter table public.organizations enable row level security;

create policy "Users read own orgs"
  on public.organizations for select
  using (public.is_org_member(id));
```

The full worked policy set — the `is_org_member` / `is_org_admin` helper functions and
every select/insert/update/delete policy across organizations, members, projects, and
tasks — is in [references/rls-policies.md](references/rls-policies.md). Name policies
after who and what action (`"Admins manage members"`, `"Assignee updates tasks"`).

### Step 3: Apply Migration and Generate Types

```bash
# Apply migration locally
npx supabase db reset

# Or push to a linked remote project
npx supabase db push

# Generate TypeScript types from the live schema
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > types/supabase.ts
```

Pass the generated `Database` type as the generic parameter to `createClient` (see
`import type { Database } from './types/supabase'`) for end-to-end type safety on every
query. Full typed-client walkthrough — typed inserts, foreign-key joins, nested multi-table
joins, and an RLS-enforcement check — is in
[references/typescript-client.md](references/typescript-client.md).

## Output

- SQL migration file under `supabase/migrations/` with all tables, constraints, and indexes
- RLS policies matching the access control rules from requirements
- Helper functions (`is_org_member`, `is_org_admin`) for reusable authorization checks
- `moddatetime` triggers for automatic `updated_at` management
- Generated TypeScript types at `types/supabase.ts` for type-safe client queries
- Partial indexes on frequently filtered columns (status, due_date)

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `42P07: relation already exists` | Table name collision in migration | Use `create table if not exists` or rename the table |
| `23503: foreign key violation` | Insert references a nonexistent parent row | Insert parent rows first, or check the UUID |
| `42501: insufficient privilege` | RLS helper function permissions | Add `security definer` to the function definition |
| `42883: function uuid_generate_v4() does not exist` | Extension not enabled | Add `create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp"` |
| `supabase db push` succeeds but tables missing | Migration was already recorded | Check `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` and repair |
| `PGRST204: column not found` | TypeScript types out of sync | Re-run `npx supabase gen types typescript --local > types/supabase.ts` |
| `new row violates row-level security` | RLS policy blocks the operation | Verify `auth.uid()` matches expected value; check policy `using` clause |
| `moddatetime` trigger fails | Extension not enabled | Add `create extension if not exists "moddatetime"` at top of migration |

## Examples

**E-commerce schema** (different domain, same pattern). The complete e-commerce
migration SQL — stores, products, orders, order_items with FKs and indexes — is in
[references/worked-schema-examples.md](references/worked-schema-examples.md), and the
matching typed client queries are in
[references/typescript-client.md](references/typescript-client.md).
