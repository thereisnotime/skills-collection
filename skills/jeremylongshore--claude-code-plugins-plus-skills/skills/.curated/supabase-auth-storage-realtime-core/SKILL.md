# Supabase Auth + Storage + Realtime Core

## Overview

Implement the three pillars that turn a Supabase database into a full application backend: user authentication (email/password, OAuth, magic links, session lifecycle), file storage (uploads, downloads, signed URLs, bucket-level RLS policies), and real-time subscriptions (Postgres change events, client-to-client broadcast, presence tracking). Every operation integrates with Row-Level Security through `auth.uid()`.

Each pillar below carries a lean skeleton in this file; the full, copy-paste walkthroughs live in `references/` so this file stays scannable.

## Prerequisites

- Supabase project created at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` v2 installed (`npm install @supabase/supabase-js`)
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` available from project Settings > API
- For Python: `pip install supabase` (wraps `postgrest-py`, `gotrue-py`, `storage3`, `realtime-py`)

## Instructions

Read the file (Read), edit or create the client and route/component code (Write, Edit), and grep the project (Grep) to reuse an existing Supabase client before creating a new one. Use `Bash(npm:*)` to install the SDK and `Bash(supabase:*)` to run migrations/policies.

### Step 1: Auth — registration, login, OAuth

Initialize the client once, then wire the flows your app needs. The skeleton:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL!, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!)

// Email/password
await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })

// OAuth — redirect the user to data.url
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })

// React to session changes (SIGNED_IN / SIGNED_OUT / TOKEN_REFRESHED)
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => { /* update UI */ })
```

Full auth walkthrough — OAuth callback, magic link, session lifecycle, password reset: [references/auth.md](references/auth.md). Python: [references/python-examples.md](references/python-examples.md).

### Step 2: Storage — upload, download, secure with bucket policies

Public buckets serve via CDN URLs; private buckets require signed URLs. The skeleton:

```typescript
// Upload to the signed-in user's own folder (RLS enforces ownership)
await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(`${userId}/avatar.png`, file, { upsert: true })

// Public URL (public bucket) vs. time-limited signed URL (private bucket)
supabase.storage.from('avatars').getPublicUrl(`${userId}/avatar.png`)
await supabase.storage.from('documents').createSignedUrl('reports/q4.pdf', 3600)
```

Full storage walkthrough — download, list, delete, and the bucket RLS policies that enforce per-user access: [references/storage.md](references/storage.md). Python: [references/python-examples.md](references/python-examples.md).

### Step 3: Realtime — Postgres changes, broadcast, presence

Three channel types: database change listeners, client-to-client broadcast, and presence. The skeleton:

```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel('chat-room')
  .on('postgres_changes',
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'messages' },
    (payload) => console.log('New:', payload.new))
  .subscribe()
// One-time table setup: ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE messages;
supabase.removeChannel(channel)  // clean up
```

Full realtime walkthrough — UPDATE/DELETE filters, RLS-scoped subscriptions, broadcast, and presence tracking: [references/realtime.md](references/realtime.md). Python: [references/python-examples.md](references/python-examples.md).

## Output

- Auth: user registration, password login, OAuth flow (Google/GitHub), magic link, session lifecycle with `onAuthStateChange`, password reset
- Storage: file upload/download, public URLs for CDN-served assets, time-limited signed URLs for private files, bucket-level RLS policies using `auth.uid()` and `storage.foldername()`
- Realtime: Postgres change subscriptions with server-side filters, broadcast channels for client-to-client messaging, presence tracking for online status

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `AuthApiError: User already registered` | Duplicate email signup | Use `signInWithPassword` or check existence first |
| `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials` | Wrong email or password | Verify credentials; check email confirmation status |
| `AuthApiError: Email not confirmed` | User has not clicked confirmation link | Resend with `resend({ type: 'signup', email })` |
| `StorageApiError: Bucket not found` | Bucket does not exist | Create via dashboard or `INSERT INTO storage.buckets` |
| `StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security` | RLS policy blocking the operation | Verify `storage.objects` policies match the user and bucket |
| `StorageApiError: The resource already exists` | File exists and `upsert: false` | Set `upsert: true` to overwrite or use a unique path |
| `Realtime: channel error` or `TIMED_OUT` | Network issues or Realtime not enabled | Check `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE` for the target table |
| `Realtime: too many channels` | Exceeded concurrent channel limit | Unsubscribe unused channels with `removeChannel()` |

## Examples

The end-to-end flow — sign in, upload an avatar to the user's RLS-guarded folder, resolve its public URL, and subscribe to live profile updates — is in [references/examples.md](references/examples.md). Each step composes the three skeletons above with no new API surface.
