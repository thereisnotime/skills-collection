# Supabase Observability

## Overview

Monitor Supabase projects end-to-end: Dashboard reports for API/database/auth metrics, `supabase inspect db` CLI for deep Postgres diagnostics, `pg_stat_statements` for query analytics, log drains for external aggregation, Edge Functions for custom metrics, and alerting on quota thresholds.

Follow the three steps below from this file for the high-level workflow, then drill into the linked `references/` files for the full commands, SQL, and function source.

## Prerequisites

- Supabase CLI installed (`npx supabase --version`)
- Supabase project linked (`supabase link --project-ref <ref>`)
- Pro plan or higher for log drain support and extended log retention
- `@supabase/supabase-js` v2+ installed for application-level monitoring

## Instructions

### Step 1: Dashboard Reports and CLI Inspect Commands

Start with the built-in **Dashboard > Reports** (API Requests, Database, Auth Usage, Storage, Realtime) for high-level metrics. For deeper Postgres diagnostics, use the `supabase inspect db` subcommands — begin with cache hit ratio and sequential scans:

```bash
# Cache hit ratio — should be > 99% (below 95% means upgrade compute)
npx supabase inspect db cache-hit --linked

# Sequential scans — tables needing indexes
npx supabase inspect db seq-scans --linked
```

The full report table plus all nine inspect subcommands (table sizes, index usage, long-running queries, bloat, blocking, replication slots, and more) are in [references/cli-inspect-commands.md](references/cli-inspect-commands.md).

### Step 2: Query Analytics with pg_stat_statements and Log Drains

Enable `pg_stat_statements` for query-level metrics, then rank queries by execution time:

```sql
create extension if not exists pg_stat_statements;

-- Top slowest queries by average execution time
select substring(query, 1, 80) as query_preview, calls,
  round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as avg_ms
from pg_stat_statements
where mean_exec_time > 50
order by mean_exec_time desc limit 20;
```

Forward logs to external aggregation with a log drain:

```bash
npx supabase log-drains add --name datadog-drain --type datadog \
  --datadog-api-key "$DATADOG_API_KEY" --datadog-region us1 --linked
```

The complete slow-query / high-frequency / connection-monitoring SQL set and every log-drain command (Datadog, webhook, list, remove) are in [references/query-analytics-and-log-drains.md](references/query-analytics-and-log-drains.md).

### Step 3: Custom Metrics, Alerting, and Health Checks

Emit business-level metrics from a scheduled Edge Function, alert on quota thresholds, and expose a health endpoint for uptime monitors. The skeleton of the metrics collector:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/collect-metrics/index.ts — see reference for full source
const DB_LIMIT_MB = 8000; // 8GB Pro plan limit
if (dbSize > DB_LIMIT_MB * 0.85) {
  console.warn(`[QUOTA_ALERT] Database at ${Math.round(dbSize / DB_LIMIT_MB * 100)}% capacity`);
}
```

Schedule it every 15 minutes via `[functions.collect-metrics]` in `config.toml`. The complete collector, the multi-service health-check endpoint, and Realtime connection monitoring are in [references/custom-metrics-and-health-checks.md](references/custom-metrics-and-health-checks.md). For external alert rules, see the Prometheus AlertManager set in [references/alert-configuration.md](references/alert-configuration.md).

## Output

- Dashboard reports configured for API, database, and auth monitoring
- CLI inspect commands available for Postgres diagnostics (table sizes, index usage, cache hits, sequential scans, long-running queries)
- `pg_stat_statements` enabled with slow-query and high-frequency-query views
- Log drains forwarding to external tools (Datadog, Logflare, or webhook)
- Custom metrics Edge Function collecting quota-relevant data on a schedule
- Health check endpoint returning per-service status with latency
- Alerting on quota thresholds (database size, user count)

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `pg_stat_statements` returns no rows | Extension not enabled | Enable via Dashboard > Database > Extensions |
| `supabase inspect db` fails | CLI not linked to project | Run `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` |
| Log drain not receiving events | API key invalid or region mismatch | Verify credentials; check `supabase log-drains list` |
| Cache hit ratio below 95% | Working set exceeds RAM | Upgrade compute add-on or optimize queries |
| Health check returns 503 | One or more services degraded | Check `detail` field in response; verify service role key |
| Edge Function cron not firing | Missing `schedule` in config.toml | Add `[functions.<name>]` with `schedule` field and redeploy |
| Long-running queries growing | Missing indexes or lock contention | Run `inspect db seq-scans` and `inspect db blocking` |

## Examples

A one-shot diagnostic bash script that runs every inspect command in sequence, plus the `app_metrics` backing table schema with a 90-day retention policy, are in [references/diagnostic-scripts.md](references/diagnostic-scripts.md). For application-level Prometheus instrumentation of the Supabase client, see [references/metrics-collection.md](references/metrics-collection.md).
