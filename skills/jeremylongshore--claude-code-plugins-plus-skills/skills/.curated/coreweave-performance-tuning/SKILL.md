# CoreWeave Performance Tuning

## Overview

Tune GPU inference or training only against measured throughput, latency, quality,
availability, and cost targets. A higher utilization figure is not a success if it
causes queueing, memory pressure, or a customer-facing SLO regression.

## Prerequisites

- A baseline for p95/p99 latency, throughput, error rate, GPU memory, and utilization.
- A representative non-sensitive evaluation set and a named owner for the SLO.
- A staging lane and a rollback manifest for every resource or serving change.

## Instructions

1. Change one variable at a time—batching, GPU class, replicas, or memory target.
2. Run the agreed load and quality evaluation in staging, then compare with baseline.
3. Promote a canary only when all SLO and quality thresholds pass for the observation window.
4. Revert to the prior manifest when latency, errors, or quality crosses the agreed limit.

## GPU Selection by Workload

| Workload | Recommended GPU | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| LLM inference (7-13B) | A100 80GB | Good balance of memory and cost |
| LLM inference (70B+) | 8xH100 | NVLink for tensor parallelism |
| Image generation | L40 | Good for diffusion models |
| Training (large models) | 8xH100 SXM5 | Fastest interconnect |
| Batch processing | A100 40GB | Cost-effective |

## Inference Optimization

```yaml
# Continuous batching with vLLM
containers:
  - name: vllm
    args:
      - "--model=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
      - "--max-num-batched-tokens=8192"
      - "--max-num-seqs=256"
      - "--gpu-memory-utilization=0.90"
      - "--enable-prefix-caching"
      - "--dtype=float16"
```

## Autoscaling Tuning

```yaml
# HPA based on GPU utilization
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: inference-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: inference-server
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Pods
      pods:
        metric:
          name: DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL
        target:
          type: AverageValue
          averageValue: "70"
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | A100-80GB | H100-80GB |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Llama-8B tokens/sec | ~2,000 | ~4,500 |
| Llama-70B tokens/sec | ~200 (4x) | ~500 (4x) |
| Cold start (vLLM) | 30-60s | 20-40s |

## Output

- A measured performance baseline and a single reviewed tuning recommendation.
- A canary result covering throughput, latency, error rate, GPU memory, and quality.
- A versioned rollback manifest with a named decision owner.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Safe response |
|---|---|
| GPU memory exceeds the guardrail | Restore the previous batch or memory setting and investigate the request distribution. |
| Latency rises after batching | Reduce concurrency or restore replica count; do not raise timeouts to hide the regression. |
| Evaluation quality drops | Route the canary back to the baseline configuration and preserve aggregate results. |
| Autoscaler oscillates | Restore stable bounds and tune from a longer measured window. |

## Examples

Run a staging canary and save only aggregate measurements for review:

```bash
kubectl -n inference-staging apply -f inference-tuned.yaml
kubectl -n inference-staging rollout status deployment/inference-server --timeout=10m
./scripts/load-test --target staging --duration 15m --report aggregate.json
```

If the report breaches the signed SLO or quality threshold, apply the previous
manifest immediately and attach `aggregate.json` to the change record.
