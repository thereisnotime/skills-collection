# Anthropic Cost Tuning

## Overview

Optimize Claude API spend through model routing, prompt caching, the Message Batches API, and real-time cost tracking. The four biggest levers: model selection (4-19x), prompt caching (10x input), batches (2x), and `max_tokens` discipline.

## Pricing Reference (per million tokens)

| Model | Input | Output | Cache Read | Cache Write |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Claude Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 | $0.08 | $1.00 |
| Claude Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | $0.30 | $3.75 |
| Claude Opus | $15.00 | $75.00 | $1.50 | $18.75 |

**Message Batches:** 50% off all model pricing for async processing.

## Cost Calculator

```python
def estimate_cost(
    input_tokens: int,
    output_tokens: int,
    model: str = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    cached_input: int = 0,
    use_batch: bool = False
) -> float:
    pricing = {
        "claude-haiku-4-20250514": {"input": 0.80, "output": 4.00, "cache_read": 0.08},
        "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {"input": 3.00, "output": 15.00, "cache_read": 0.30},
        "claude-opus-4-20250514": {"input": 15.00, "output": 75.00, "cache_read": 1.50},
    }
    rates = pricing[model]
    uncached_input = input_tokens - cached_input

    cost = (
        uncached_input * rates["input"] +
        cached_input * rates["cache_read"] +
        output_tokens * rates["output"]
    ) / 1_000_000

    if use_batch:
        cost *= 0.5

    return cost

# Example: 10K requests/day, 500 input + 200 output tokens each
daily = estimate_cost(500, 200, "claude-sonnet-4-20250514") * 10_000
print(f"Daily: ${daily:.2f}")      # ~$0.045 * 10K = $450/day
print(f"Monthly: ${daily * 30:.2f}")  # ~$13,500/month

# Same with Haiku + batching
daily_optimized = estimate_cost(500, 200, "claude-haiku-4-20250514", use_batch=True) * 10_000
print(f"Optimized: ${daily_optimized:.2f}/day")  # ~$22/day (20x cheaper)
```

## Strategy 1: Model Routing

```python
def route_to_model(task: str, complexity: str) -> str:
    """Route tasks to cheapest adequate model."""
    # Haiku: classification, extraction, yes/no, routing ($0.80/$4)
    if task in ("classify", "extract", "route", "validate"):
        return "claude-haiku-4-20250514"

    # Sonnet: general tasks, code, tool use ($3/$15)
    if complexity in ("low", "medium"):
        return "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

    # Opus: only for complex reasoning, research ($15/$75)
    return "claude-opus-4-20250514"
```

## Strategy 2: Prompt Caching

```python
# Cache system prompts and reference documents (90% input savings)
# Break-even: 2 requests with same cached content
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=256,
    system=[{
        "type": "text",
        "text": large_reference_document,  # 10K+ tokens
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
    }],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_question}]
)
```

## Strategy 3: Batches for Non-Real-Time

```python
# 50% cost reduction for anything that doesn't need immediate response
# Ideal for: summarization pipelines, data extraction, content generation
batch = client.messages.batches.create(requests=[...])  # Up to 100K requests
```

## Strategy 4: Spend Tracking

```python
import anthropic
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class SpendTracker:
    budget_usd: float = 100.0
    spent_usd: float = 0.0
    requests: int = 0

    def track(self, response):
        cost = estimate_cost(
            response.usage.input_tokens,
            response.usage.output_tokens,
            response.model,
            getattr(response.usage, "cache_read_input_tokens", 0)
        )
        self.spent_usd += cost
        self.requests += 1

        if self.spent_usd > self.budget_usd * 0.8:
            print(f"WARNING: 80% budget used (${self.spent_usd:.2f}/${self.budget_usd})")
        if self.spent_usd > self.budget_usd:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Budget exceeded: ${self.spent_usd:.2f}")

tracker = SpendTracker(budget_usd=50.0)
```

## Cost Reduction Checklist

- [ ] Use Haiku for classification/extraction/routing tasks
- [ ] Enable prompt caching for repeated system prompts
- [ ] Use Message Batches for non-real-time processing
- [ ] Set `max_tokens` to realistic values (not maximum)
- [ ] Use prefill to reduce output preamble tokens
- [ ] Implement spend tracking and budget alerts
- [ ] Monitor via [Usage API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/usage-cost-api)

## Prerequisites

- Establish an approved budget, billing owner, cost allocation dimensions, and alert thresholds before changing model routing or batch behavior.
- Use a sandbox workspace, synthetic prompts, pinned model IDs, and a versioned pricing snapshot; confirm current rates in the official pricing documentation before making a forecast.
- Configure least-privileged credentials and ensure logs/metrics contain token counts and aggregate cost only, never prompt or response content.

## Instructions

1. Baseline request volume, input/output/cache tokens, latency, quality, and spend by feature using a redacted measurement window. Do not make routing changes from a single outlier.
2. Define a quality floor and route only eligible workloads to the least expensive model that meets it. Use prompt caching only for approved non-sensitive content and batches only where asynchronous completion is acceptable.
3. Cap `max_tokens`, concurrency, retries, and batch size. Enforce per-feature and per-workspace budgets before requests are sent; fail closed when a budget or scope check cannot be evaluated.
4. Test the proposed policy on synthetic fixtures in a sandbox, then canary it with aggregate cost, quality, latency, error, and rate-limit monitoring. Require owner approval before broader rollout.
5. If quality, spend, or policy thresholds regress, disable the new route/cache/batch policy, restore the prior configuration, and retain a redacted comparison receipt.

## Output

Produce a cost-control receipt containing the pricing snapshot date, policy version, model/batch/cache decisions, token aggregates, projected and observed spend, quality and latency results, budget outcome, canary scope, approval, and rollback reference. Exclude prompt/response text, customer identifiers, API keys, and raw billing exports.

## Error Handling

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Unknown model price or usage field | Stop forecasting, refresh the official pricing/usage source, and mark the estimate provisional. |
| Budget or quota exceeded | Reject or queue new work, alert the owner, and do not bypass the guard with another key or workspace. |
| Quality regression after cheaper routing | Restore the prior route, quarantine affected output, and rerun the quality fixture before another canary. |
| Cache or batch unsuitable for data/latency policy | Disable that optimization and use the approved synchronous, non-cached path. |

## Examples

Evaluate 1,000 synthetic classification prompts in a sandbox with a fixed budget, compare pinned Sonnet against Haiku plus an approved batch policy, assert `customer_content_logged=0`, and emit `budget=within_limit; quality=pass; canary=internal; rollback=route-v1`. Do not use live customer prompts to tune pricing.
