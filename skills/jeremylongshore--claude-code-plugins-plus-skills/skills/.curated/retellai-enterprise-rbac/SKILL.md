# Retell AI Enterprise Rbac

## Overview

Implementation patterns for Retell AI enterprise rbac — voice agent and telephony platform.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `retellai-install-auth` setup

## Instructions

### Step 1: SDK Pattern

```typescript
import Retell from 'retell-sdk';
const retell = new Retell({ apiKey: process.env.RETELL_API_KEY! });

const agents = await retell.agent.list();
console.log(`Agents: ${agents.length}`);
```

## Output

- Retell AI integration for enterprise rbac

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check RETELL_API_KEY |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid parameters | Check API documentation |

## Examples

### Grant a release operator access without granting call-data access

Create a role limited to publishing an approved agent version and inspecting
deployment status. Do not include transcript, recording, billing, or user
management permissions in that role. Test the role against a preview agent:
it should promote the designated version but fail to retrieve protected call
content. Record the role, environment, and approver before assigning it to a
new operator, and remove the assignment when the release window closes.
