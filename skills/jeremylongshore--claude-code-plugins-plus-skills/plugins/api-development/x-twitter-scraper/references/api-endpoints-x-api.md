# Xquik REST API endpoints: direct X lookups

These metered reads require Xquik credentials. Visible tweet, article, search,
and profile lookups do not require a connected X account. Connect an X account
only for sections that explicitly require private or account-scoped access.

Most metered lookups use only `XQUIK_API_KEY`. Only the private or account-context routes
name a connected X account requirement.

## Get tweet

```http
GET /x/tweets/{id}
```

Returns the tweet, its author, engagement counts, and available media URLs. Engagement can include likes, retweets, replies, quotes, views, and bookmarks.

## Get article

```http
GET /x/articles/{tweetId}
```

Retrieve an X Article by numeric tweet ID. For an article URL, use its final
status ID. The response wraps content in `article` and profile data in
`author`. Metered.

The API returns:
```json
{
  "article": {
    "title": "How API retries work",
    "previewText": "A short preview.",
    "coverImageUrl": "https://pbs.twimg.com/...",
    "bodyText": "Retry safe reads after transient failures.",
    "contents": [{ "type": "paragraph", "text": "Retry safe reads after transient failures." }],
    "createdAt": "2026-02-24T10:30:00.000Z",
    "likeCount": 5200,
    "replyCount": 245,
    "quoteCount": 90,
    "viewCount": 150000
  },
  "author": {
    "id": "44196397",
    "username": "elonmusk",
    "name": "Elon Musk"
  }
}
```

## Search tweets

```http
GET /x/tweets/search?q=<percent-encoded-query>
```

Use X search syntax with keywords, `#hashtags`, `from:user`, `to:user`, `"exact phrases"`, `OR`, and `-exclude`.
Build the query string with a URL encoder. Do not interpolate raw search text:

```javascript
const tweetSearch = new URLSearchParams({ q: 'from:openai "agents sdk"' });
const tweetSearchPath = `/x/tweets/search?${tweetSearch}`;
```

Returns tweets with available `likeCount`, `retweetCount`, `replyCount`, and media. The API omits unavailable fields.
Fresh cursorless `queryType=Latest` pagination returns newest-first across pages.
Existing cursors keep their established ordering.

## Get user

```http
GET /x/users/{id}
```

Returns profile info. `id` accepts either an X username without `@` or a numeric user ID. Fields `id`, `username`, `name` are always present. All other fields (`description`, `followers`, `following`, `verified`, `profilePicture`, `location`, `createdAt`, `statusesCount`) are optional and omitted when unavailable.

## Batch and search users

```http
GET /x/users/batch?ids=44196397,783214
GET /x/users/search?q=<percent-encoded-query>&minFollowers=1000&verifiedOnly=true
```

```javascript
const userSearch = new URLSearchParams({
  q: "founder & researcher",
  minFollowers: "1000",
  verifiedOnly: "true",
});
const userSearchPath = `/x/users/search?${userSearch}`;
```

Batch lookup accepts up to 100 comma-separated numeric user IDs.
Search returns matching profiles and may include a `cursor`. All supported
filters apply before billing.

Supported filters are `minFollowers`, `maxFollowers`, `minFollowing`, `maxFollowing`,
`minStatuses`, `maxStatuses`, `minAccountAgeDays`, `verifiedOnly`,
`verifiedType`, `hasWebsite`, `hasLocation`, `bioContains`, `locationContains`,
and `usernameContains`. `minPosts` and `maxPosts` alias the status filters.
Text filters ignore case. `bioContains` matches any comma- or line-separated
term. Count filters use inclusive bounds.

## Check follower

```http
GET /x/followers/check?source={username}&target={username}
```

Returns `isFollowing` and `isFollowedBy` for both directions.

## Get user tweets

```http
GET /x/users/{id}/tweets
```

Get a user's recent tweets by user ID. Metered per returned tweet.

## Batch tweets

```http

```

Get multiple tweets by comma-separated tweet IDs. Maximum 100 IDs.

GET /x/tweets/{id}/thread
```

Read quote tweets, replies, retweeters, or the conversation thread for a tweet. These are paginated read operations.

Thread reads accept these 32 effective result filters:
`fromUser`, `toUser`, `mentioning`, `language`, `sinceDate`, `untilDate`,
`mediaType`, `minFaves`, `minRetweets`, `minReplies`, `minQuotes`, `minViews`,
`minBookmarks`, `maxFaves`, `maxRetweets`, `maxReplies`, `maxQuotes`,
`blueVerifiedOnly`, `verifiedOnly`, `replies`, `retweets`, `quotes`,
`exactPhrase`, `excludeWords`, `anyWords`, `hashtags`, `cashtags`, `url`,
`conversationId`, `inReplyToTweetId`, `quotesOfTweetId`, and
`retweetsOfTweetId`. Thread reads do not accept `nativeRetweets`, `sinceTime`,
or `untilTime`.

## Follower and mention reads

```http
GET /x/users/{id}/followers
GET /x/users/{id}/following
GET /x/users/{id}/mentions
GET /x/users/{id}/verified-followers
```

Read followers, following, mentions, and verified followers for a username or numeric user ID. These are paginated read operations.

Before calling any listed endpoint:

1. Confirm the exact target username or user ID. Stop if the target is ambiguous.
2. Confirm an authorized purpose and applicable legal basis.
3. Set a finite result cap and pagination limit.
4. Name the intended recipients and secure destination.
5. Respect visibility restrictions and access controls.
6. Confirm retention and a deletion date.
7. Get separate confirmation before forwarding or exporting results.

Never use a default or inferred account.

## Automatic cursor recovery

This contract applies to Tweet search, user Tweets, user replies, Tweet replies,
followers, following, and verified followers.

- `400 invalid_coverage_cursor`: Restart without the malformed cursor.
- `409 coverage_cursor_unavailable`: Wait the exact `Retry-After` seconds. Retry the same cursor once.
- `410 coverage_cursor_gone`: The cursor finished, expired, was superseded, or no longer matches the request identity. The response omits `Retry-After`. Restart without a cursor and deduplicate by ID.
