# Xquik REST API endpoints: draws

## Protect giveaway participant data

Draw creation and participant exports are metered or privacy-sensitive actions.
Confirm the source tweet, eligibility rules, requested data type, export
audience, and retention plan. Use the smallest necessary dataset. Do not
export entries for surveillance, discrimination, harassment, or unrelated
secondary use.
Draw history and results are account-scoped private reads. Require exact-scope
approval before listing draws or retrieving winners.

## Create draw

```http
POST /draws
```

Run a giveaway draw from a tweet. The draw selects random winners from replies.
Remaining credits cap how many replies and retweeters the draw inspects before
it applies filters. `totalEntries` and `validEntries` describe that inspected
set. They may not cover every reply or retweet on the source tweet.

Build the exact request first. Show the source tweet, winner count, backup
count, and every filter. Show a published usage estimate when one is available.
Otherwise, state that no precise preflight estimate is available and explain
the credit-derived inspection cap. Never invent an estimate. Also show the
lawful purpose, participant-data handling, export audience, and retention plan.
Obtain approval for every displayed field before creating the draw or
persisting participant data.

Send this body:
```json
{
  "tweetUrl": "https://x.com/user/status/1893456789012345678",
  "winnerCount": 3,
  "backupCount": 2,
  "uniqueAuthorsOnly": true,
  "mustRetweet": true,
  "mustFollowUsername": "burakbayir",
  "filterMinFollowers": 100,
  "filterAccountAgeDays": 30,
  "filterLanguage": "en",
  "requiredKeywords": ["giveaway"],
  "requiredHashtags": ["#contest"],
  "requiredMentions": ["@xquik"]
}
```

All filter fields are optional. Only `tweetUrl` is required.

The API returns:
```json
{
  "id": "42",
  "tweetId": "1893456789012345678",
  "totalEntries": 1500,
  "validEntries": 890,
  "winners": []
}
```

## List draws

```http
GET /draws
```

Cursor-paginated. Returns compact draw objects.

This is a private read. Show the exact account, requested page scope, and returned
field scope. List draws only after explicit approval for that exact read.

## Get draw

```http
GET /draws/{id}
```

Returns `{ "draw": { ... }, "winners": [] }`. The nested `draw` contains
source Tweet metadata and inspected entry counts. The counts can reflect a
credit-limited candidate set.

This is a private read. Show the exact account, draw ID, and returned-data scope.
Retrieve details only after explicit approval for that exact read.

## Export draw

```http
GET /draws/{id}/export?format=csv&type=winners
```

Choose `csv`, `json`, `md`, `md-document`, `pdf`, `txt`, or `xlsx`. Choose `winners` or `entries`; the default is `winners`. Entry exports support 100,000 rows, except PDF supports 10,000.

Get approval first. Full entry exports can contain participant identity and
activity data. Show the lawful purpose, exact draw, type, format, audience, and
retention period. Export only after explicit approval for that exact request.
Prefer winners-only output. Do not retain data beyond the confirmed purpose.
