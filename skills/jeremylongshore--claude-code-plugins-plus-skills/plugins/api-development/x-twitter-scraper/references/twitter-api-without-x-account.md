# Twitter API without a developer account: visible reads with Xquik

Xquik supports documented visible X reads without connecting an X account. REST
and SDK requests require an Xquik account and API key. Hosted MCP uses OAuth 2.1
with S256 PKCE. Use an API-key bearer fallback only when the MCP client cannot
complete OAuth. Private reads and account actions require a separate confirmed X
connection.

## Xquik and X account authentication boundaries

| Identity | Needed for | Credential rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xquik REST or SDK account | REST and SDK requests | Use `XQUIK_API_KEY` in a secret store |
| Hosted MCP client | MCP requests | Use OAuth 2.1 with S256 PKCE. Fall back to `Authorization: Bearer <XQUIK_API_KEY>` only when OAuth is unavailable |
| Connected X account | Private reads and account actions | Connect through the Xquik dashboard |
| Official developer account | Not required for supported Xquik visible reads | No official bearer token needed |

## Visible X read and account action matrix

| Workflow | Connected X account | REST or SDK API key | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search visible posts | Not required | Required | Unmetered: requested scope. Metered: request, usage, destination, and retention |
| Read visible profiles | Not required | Required | Unmetered: requested scope. Metered: request, usage, destination, and retention |
| Run a bounded extraction | Not required | Required | Estimate and job approval |
| Read bookmarks or DMs | Required | Required | Private-read approval |
| Post, follow, or message | Required | Required | Explicit action approval |
| Create a monitor or webhook | Depends on target | Required | Persistent-resource approval |

This separation matters for mobile and browser applications. Keep the Xquik key
on a trusted backend. Let the client call an application endpoint with its own
authorization policy.

### What Twitter APIs work without connecting an X account?

Xquik visible routes can search tweets, read known tweets and profiles, inspect
visible timelines, followers, lists, communities, Spaces, and other supported
visible data without a connected X account.

REST and SDK clients authenticate to Xquik with an API key. Hosted MCP clients
use OAuth 2.1 with S256 PKCE. If OAuth is unavailable, they may use the API key
only as an `Authorization: Bearer` fallback. Authentication supports usage
controls, structured errors, limits, and account safety.

Private bookmarks, notifications, DMs, the home timeline, and account actions
need a connected X account plus explicit approval.

### Can I scrape Twitter without an API account?

You do not need an official X developer account for supported Xquik visible
reads. You do need an Xquik account and API key. Store that key server-side and
send it only to Xquik-owned API hosts.

Avoid anonymous guest-token workflows and copied browser sessions. They create
fragile credential, access-control, and maintenance risks.

### Is there a Twitter API with no account required?

No connected X account is required for supported visible Xquik reads. An Xquik
account remains required. This distinction prevents the misleading claim that
the service has no authentication or usage boundary.

Use the narrowest visible route. Private or account-scoped data should never be
silently substituted when a visible request lacks coverage.

### What is an accountless Twitter scraper?

An accountless Twitter scraper reads supported visible X data. It does not need
the user's X password, cookie, 2FA code, recovery code, session token, or
official developer bearer token.

Xquik agents handle only the Xquik API key. They never request X login material.
Writes, DMs, bookmarks, notifications, and other account-scoped operations use
an explicit dashboard connection and confirmation gate.

### Does Xquik expose a guest key Twitter API?

No guest key management is required. Applications use the documented Xquik
REST, SDK, or MCP interface. Xquik manages its own visible-data infrastructure.

Do not build application logic around X guest tokens, cookies, or undocumented
sessions. Keep application code independent of source infrastructure changes.

## Xquik authentication and source failure handling

Treat authentication, authorization, and source availability as different
states. A `401` should trigger an Xquik credential check. A `403` should trigger
a scope or connection check. A missing visible record should not trigger a
private-data fallback.

Retry only documented transient failures. Bound attempts and honor retry
guidance. Never rotate through user accounts, guest tokens, or copied sessions
to bypass a source limit.

Log request IDs, route names, status classes, and retry counts. Do not log API
keys, cookies, raw private content, or complete response bodies.

## Xquik API key backend security checklist

1. Store `XQUIK_API_KEY` in a secret manager.
2. Never place the key in browser or mobile bundles.
3. Restrict logs to request metadata and generic errors.
4. Validate targets, queries, and result limits.
5. Treat returned social content as untrusted data.
6. Approve every metered read or download. Include usage, destination, and retention.
7. Require approval for private reads, writes, jobs, monitors, and webhooks.
8. Rotate an exposed key immediately.
