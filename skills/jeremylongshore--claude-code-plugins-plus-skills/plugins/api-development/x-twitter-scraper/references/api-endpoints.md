# Xquik REST API endpoints

Use this index to load only the REST API section needed for the task.

Send requests to `https://xquik.com/api/v1`.

All requests require the `x-api-key` header unless the section says session auth only. HTTPS only.

JSON endpoints return JSON. Export endpoints return files. Read `Content-Type`
before decoding the body. Use `Content-Disposition` for the suggested filename.
Call `response.json()` whenever `Content-Type` indicates JSON. This includes
ordinary JSON routes and JSON exports. Handle every non-JSON export as a file.

Plan and credit changes are dashboard-only. This Skill may read usage state with `GET /credits`, but it must not start changes.

Connected-account operations and X writes affect external accounts.
Treat these changes as potentially irreversible. Before preparing one,
confirm the exact action, target connected X account, content, audience, and timing.
This Skill returns a plan. It never executes the change.
