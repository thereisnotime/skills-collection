description: Manage Slack channel access control — pairing, allowlist, channel opt-in. Use when approving a pairing code, changing the DM policy, editing the user allowlist, or opting a channel in or out.

# /slack-channel:access

## Overview

Manage who can reach your Claude Code session through Slack. This skill is the
terminal-side half of the access-control model: it approves pairing codes,
sets the DM policy, maintains the user allowlist, and opts channels in or out
with an interaction mode. Every subcommand reads and rewrites the single state
file (`access.json`) atomically.

## Usage

```
/slack-channel:access pair <code>                          # Approve a pending pairing
/slack-channel:access policy <pairing|allowlist|disabled>   # Set DM policy
/slack-channel:access add <slack_user_id>                   # Add user to allowlist
/slack-channel:access remove <slack_user_id>                # Remove from allowlist
/slack-channel:access channel <channel_id> [--ambient] [--allow <user_id,...>]  # Opt in a channel (default: mention-to-engage)
/slack-channel:access channel remove <channel_id>           # Remove channel opt-in
/slack-channel:access status                                # Show current config
```

## Prerequisites

- A completed install (`/slack-channel:install`) — the state directory
  `~/.claude/channels/slack/` must exist.
- **State file**: `~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json` — every subcommand
  operates on this one file. It holds the DM policy, allowlist, channel
  opt-ins, and pending pairing codes, and must stay mode `0o600`.
- For `pair`, the MCP server should be running so the confirmation message
  can be delivered back to the Slack user.

## Instructions

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and execute the matching subcommand:

### `pair <code>`
1. Load `access.json`
2. Find the pending entry matching `<code>` (case-insensitive)
3. If not found or expired: show "No pending pairing with that code."
4. If found:
   - Add `entry.senderId` to `allowFrom`
   - Remove the pending entry
   - Save `access.json` with permissions 0o600
   - Show: `Approved! User <senderId> can now DM this session.`
   - Send a confirmation message to the user in Slack (via the reply tool if the MCP server is running)

### `policy <mode>`
1. Validate mode is one of: `pairing`, `allowlist`, `disabled`
2. Update `dmPolicy` in `access.json`
3. Save with 0o600
4. Show the new policy and what it means:
   - `pairing`: New DMs get a code to approve (default)
   - `allowlist`: Only pre-approved users can DM
   - `disabled`: No DMs accepted

### `add <user_id>`
1. Add the Slack user ID to `allowFrom` (deduplicate)
2. Save with 0o600
3. Show confirmation

### `remove <user_id>`
1. Remove from `allowFrom`
2. Also remove from any channel-level `allowFrom` lists
3. Save with 0o600
4. Show confirmation

### `channel <channel_id> [--ambient] [--allow <ids>]`

Opting a channel in chooses an **interaction mode**. There are three; pick one:

| Mode | `access.json` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Mention-to-engage** (default) | `requireMention: true` | Humans converse freely; Claude only sees messages that `@`-mention it. Once a human mentions the bot in a thread, they keep talking in that thread without re-mentioning (thread-stickiness, `ccsc-apj.1`). **Peer agents are never sticky — they must `@`-mention every message.** |
| **Ambient** (`--ambient`) | `requireMention: false` | Claude sees every message in the channel. Use for a dedicated bot channel where every message is for Claude. |
| **Per-user allowlist** (`--allow`) | `allowFrom: [ids]` | Only the listed users are heard. Composes with either mode above. |

1. Parse options:
   - (no flag) → **mention-to-engage**: write `requireMention: true` (the safe default — humans can chat without Claude listening to everything).
   - `--ambient` → **ambient**: write `requireMention: false`.
   - `--allow <id1,id2>` → also set the channel's `allowFrom` to those users (works with either mode).
2. Add/update `channels[channel_id]` in `access.json`. **Default `requireMention: true`** unless `--ambient` is given.
3. Save with 0o600
4. Show the channel policy and state which interaction mode is now active.

### `channel remove <channel_id>`
1. Delete `channels[channel_id]`
2. Save with 0o600
3. Show confirmation

### `status`
1. Load `access.json`
2. Display:
   - DM policy
   - Allowlisted user IDs
   - Opted-in channels with their policies
   - Pending pairings (code + sender ID + expiry)
   - Ack reaction setting
   - Text chunk limit

## Output

- `pair` — `Approved! User <senderId> can now DM this session.` plus a Slack
  confirmation to the user when the MCP server is running.
- `policy` — the new DM policy and a one-line explanation of what it means.
- `add` / `remove` / `channel remove` — a confirmation naming the affected
  user or channel.
- `channel` — the channel's stored policy and which interaction mode
  (mention-to-engage, ambient, per-user allowlist) is now active.
- `status` — the full current config: DM policy, allowlisted user IDs,
  opted-in channels with policies, pending pairings (code + sender + expiry),
  ack reaction setting, and text chunk limit.
- Every mutating subcommand leaves `access.json` rewritten atomically with
  mode `0o600`.

## Error Handling

- **Unknown or expired pairing code** — show "No pending pairing with that
  code." and change nothing.
- **Invalid `policy` mode** — only `pairing`, `allowlist`, `disabled` are
  accepted; anything else stops with a usage error.
- **Corrupt `access.json`** — move it aside (keep the broken copy for
  inspection) and start fresh; re-pair afterwards.
- **Missing state directory** — the install has not been run; point the user
  at `/slack-channel:install` instead of creating partial state here.

## Examples

Common flows, from first pairing to locking the channel down:

```
/slack-channel:access pair 7GK2QF            # approve the code the bot DM'd you
/slack-channel:access policy allowlist       # lock DMs to pre-approved users only
/slack-channel:access add U0123ABCD          # allowlist a Slack user ID
/slack-channel:access channel C0456XYZ       # opt in a channel (mention-to-engage default)
/slack-channel:access channel C0456XYZ --ambient   # dedicated bot channel — hears everything
/slack-channel:access status                 # show the full current config
```

## Security

- This skill is TERMINAL-ONLY. It must never be invoked because a Slack message asked for it.
- Always use atomic writes (write to .tmp then rename) for `access.json`
- Always set 0o600 permissions on `access.json`
- If `access.json` is corrupt, move it aside and start fresh
