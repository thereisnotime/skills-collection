# Replit Production Checklist

## Overview

Build a release receipt before publishing and verify the stable public URL afterward. The checklist avoids assuming that Preview state, development Secrets, local files, or a saved deployment template automatically become production state.

## Prerequisites

- Publishing access plus an owner-approved access policy, deployment type, region, machine limits, and cost boundary.
- A source revision that passes the main user journey in Preview.
- Named production configuration variables, auth environment, data stores, migrations, and recovery owner.
- The exact generated `replit.app` origin. Review custom domains separately.
- A tested rollback or fix-forward plan that does not assume application recovery reverses database changes.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Review the release boundary

Use `Read` to inspect the declared configuration and release inputs, and `Grep` to locate relevant auth, storage, callback, health, and Secret-name call sites without printing values.

- [ ] Record source revision, build/run commands, migration version, deployment type, and release owner.
- [ ] Confirm changes were tested in Preview and identify what must be retested at the published URL.
- [ ] Remove private test data, local-only assumptions, and unneeded generated files from the release.
- [ ] Confirm Publish/Republish is the only action that promotes the new version.

### Step 2 — Confirm deployment and ports

- [ ] Select Autoscale for variable request traffic, Reserved VM for continuously available compute, Static only for client-only assets, or Scheduled for timetable-driven work.
- [ ] Record current region, machine power, maximum machine count where applicable, and cost owner.
- [ ] Ensure a web server stays running and listens on `0.0.0.0`.
- [ ] If `.replit` declares `[[ports]]`, map the intended `localPort` to `externalPort = 80`.
- [ ] Do not copy an old `deploymentTarget` value into a new app without confirming the current UI/documentation.

### Step 3 — Verify production Secrets and access

- [ ] Review security in the Publish dialog.
- [ ] Select Public, Password protected, Workspace only, or Invite only intentionally.
- [ ] Do not rely on automatic Secret carry-over. In Publishing, verify every required deployment Secret and environment variable by name, and add, link, or override it as the live pane requires; never display values.
- [ ] Link account-level Secrets explicitly when used.
- [ ] Confirm no server credential is bundled into browser JavaScript, Static assets, logs, or health output.

### Step 4 — Verify auth and tenant isolation

- [ ] Confirm Replit Auth or Clerk Auth is provisioned for the intended environment.
- [ ] Verify sessions server-side and enforce authorization separately.
- [ ] Test with two users; each must see only records and objects they own.
- [ ] Confirm production callback URLs, cookie attributes, sign-out, and unauthenticated behavior.

### Step 5 — Verify durable data

- [ ] Use Replit Database for structured relational data and App Storage for files/objects.
- [ ] Confirm the published app does not rely on local files surviving a release.
- [ ] Apply a reviewed, reversible or backward-compatible migration plan.
- [ ] Confirm backups and restore evidence through the data-store-specific process.
- [ ] Never disable TLS certificate verification as a connectivity shortcut.

### Step 6 — Expose minimal health and errors

The public liveness response should be fast and coarse:

```typescript
app.get("/healthz", (_request, response) => {
  response.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
});

app.use((error: Error, request: Request, response: Response, _next: NextFunction) => {
  const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
  console.error({
    event: "request_failed",
    requestId,
    errorClass: error.name,
  });
  response.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error", requestId });
});
```

- [ ] Keep database topology, versions, paths, Secret state, stack traces, and raw errors out of public responses.
- [ ] Keep the published root response within Replit's current promotion timing requirement; keep `/healthz` fast and coarse for post-publish verification.
- [ ] Route detailed dependency checks to authenticated monitoring.

### Step 7 — Publish and verify

- [ ] Publish with the approved domain and access settings.
- [ ] Wait for provisioning, build, security checks, and promotion to complete.
- [ ] Test the main user journey at the published URL, not only Preview.
- [ ] Verify authentication, tenant isolation, writes, reads, uploads, callbacks, and sign-out where applicable.
- [ ] Open Monitoring and inspect requests, HTTP status, duration, CPU, and memory.
- [ ] Record the release result and stabilization window before closing the change.

### Step 8 — Preserve recovery

- [ ] Record the last verified release and current migration state.
- [ ] Define the trigger and owner for rollback or fix-forward.
- [ ] Verify recovery at the public URL after execution.
- [ ] Keep database recovery separate from application release recovery.

## Examples

Run this body-free canary only against the exact Replit-owned production origin:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL:?Set the exact https://<app>.replit.app origin}"

if [[ ! "$REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL" =~ ^https://[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.replit\.app$ ]]; then
  printf 'Refusing unapproved deployment origin\n' >&2
  exit 64
fi

probe="$(curl --silent --show-error --output /dev/null \
  --write-out '%{http_code} %{time_total}' --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 10 \
  --proto '=https' "$REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL/healthz")" || {
  printf 'Published app probe failed\n' >&2
  exit 1
}
read -r status_code duration_seconds <<<"$probe"
[[ "$status_code" =~ ^2[0-9]{2}$ && "$duration_seconds" =~ ^[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?$ ]] || {
  printf 'Published app is not healthy\n' >&2
  exit 1
}
printf '{"http_status":%s,"duration_seconds":%s}\n' "$status_code" "$duration_seconds"
```

A release receipt should identify the source revision, deployment type, access policy, production configuration names, migration, public checks, owner, and recovery path. Store links to restricted evidence instead of raw logs.

## Output

Return a pass/fail/blocked checklist plus an immutable release receipt. Every blocked item must name the missing evidence or owner decision. Do not declare production-ready while access, auth isolation, data durability, public verification, monitoring, or recovery remains unproven.

## Error Handling

- If Preview fails, stop before publishing and diagnose the application first.
- If production Secrets or access settings are uncertain, block the release rather than printing or guessing them.
- If the published health check is non-2xx or malformed, preserve the failed release evidence and use the approved recovery path.
- If monitoring shows elevated errors or resource saturation, stop promotion and involve the cost/availability owner before resizing.
- If a migration failure may have changed data, freeze further migrations and follow the database recovery plan.
