# Anthropic Upgrade & Migration

## Overview

Guide for upgrading the Anthropic SDK and migrating between API versions. The SDK follows semver — major versions may have breaking changes.

## Check Current Versions

```bash
# Python
pip show anthropic | grep Version
# Version: 0.40.0

# TypeScript
npm list @anthropic-ai/sdk
# @anthropic-ai/sdk@0.35.0

# Check latest available
pip index versions anthropic 2>/dev/null | head -1
npm view @anthropic-ai/sdk version
```

## Upgrade Path

### Step 1: Create Upgrade Branch

```bash
git checkout -b upgrade/anthropic-sdk
```

### Step 2: Upgrade SDK

```bash
# Python
pip install --upgrade anthropic
pip show anthropic | grep Version

# TypeScript
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk@latest
```

### Step 3: Review Breaking Changes

Key breaking changes by version:

**Python SDK 0.20+ (anthropic-version: 2023-06-01)**

```python
# OLD: Text Completions API (deprecated)
response = client.completions.create(
    model="claude-2",
    prompt="\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant:",
    max_tokens_to_sample=256
)

# NEW: Messages API
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=256,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**Python SDK 0.30+ (streaming changes)**

```python
# OLD: Manual SSE parsing
response = client.messages.create(..., stream=True)
for line in response.iter_lines():
    ...

# NEW: High-level streaming
with client.messages.stream(...) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text)
```

**TypeScript SDK 0.20+ (import path change)**

```typescript
// OLD
import Anthropic from 'anthropic';

// NEW
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
```

### Step 4: Update API Version Header

```python
# The SDK sends anthropic-version header automatically
# To pin a specific version:
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    default_headers={"anthropic-version": "2023-06-01"}
)

# For beta features:
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    default_headers={"anthropic-beta": "token-counting-2024-11-01"}
)
```

### Step 5: Run Tests and Verify

```bash
# Run your test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v
npm test

# Verify a live call
python3 -c "
import anthropic
c = anthropic.Anthropic()
m = c.messages.create(model='claude-haiku-4-20250514', max_tokens=8, messages=[{'role':'user','content':'hi'}])
print(f'OK: {m.model} {m.usage}')
"
```

## Migration: Text Completions to Messages

| Text Completions | Messages API |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `client.completions.create()` | `client.messages.create()` |
| `prompt` (string) | `messages` (array) |
| `max_tokens_to_sample` | `max_tokens` |
| `model: "claude-2"` | `model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` |
| `\n\nHuman:...\n\nAssistant:` | `[{role: "user"}, {role: "assistant"}]` |
| `response.completion` | `response.content[0].text` |

## Rollback

```bash
# Python — pin to previous version
pip install anthropic==0.39.0

# TypeScript — pin to previous version
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk@0.34.0

# Git rollback
git checkout main -- package.json package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Prerequisites

- Record the current SDK version, lockfile digest, API version header, model identifiers, supported runtime versions, and a tested rollback revision.
- Obtain release notes from the official SDK/API sources and an approved sandbox workspace with synthetic prompts; production credentials must not be used for migration tests.
- Define compatibility, latency, cost, and response-shape acceptance thresholds and identify the owner who approves promotion.

## Instructions

1. Create a migration branch and lock the current dependency graph. Compare the target SDK and API behavior against official release notes; do not infer compatibility from a package version alone.
2. Update the SDK and request shapes in a sandbox, preserving explicit model IDs, `max_tokens`, authentication through the secret manager, and least-privileged workspace access.
3. Run unit, contract, streaming, tool-use, error, and token-count tests using synthetic fixtures. Compare redacted response-shape and usage receipts with the baseline; never log prompt or response content.
4. Canary the pinned artifact on an isolated workspace with zero customer traffic. Promote only after owner approval and threshold checks; monitor errors, latency, rate limits, and spend during the rollout.
5. If any gate fails, stop promotion, restore the prior lockfile/revision, revoke temporary credentials, and preserve the redacted migration receipt.

## Output

Produce a migration receipt containing source and target SDK versions, API-version header, lockfile/artifact digests, test and canary results, model IDs, workspace/environment, approval, rollout state, rollback reference, and retention deadline. Exclude API keys, prompt/response text, customer identifiers, and raw exception payloads.

## Error Handling

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Dependency or API contract test fails | Pin the prior version, isolate the failing fixture, and do not promote. |
| Authentication or permission failure | Stop the canary, verify the secret-manager reference and workspace scope, and never print the key. |
| 429/5xx, timeout, or latency regression | Respect SDK retry guidance, apply a bounded circuit breaker, and roll back when the canary threshold is exceeded. |
| Response-shape or tool-use drift | Quarantine the result, update the adapter only after an approved contract decision, and rerun the full suite. |

## Examples

For a synthetic migration fixture, pin `anthropic` from `0.39.0` to the reviewed target, run 100 sandbox Messages API calls with `customer=fixture-017`, assert response-shape parity and `customer_content_logged=0`, then promote to a 1% internal canary. A failed threshold yields `promotion=halted; rollback=prior-lockfile`.
