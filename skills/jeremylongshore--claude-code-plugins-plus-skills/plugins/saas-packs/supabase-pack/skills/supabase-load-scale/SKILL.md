# Supabase Load & Scale

## Overview

Supabase scaling operates at six layers: **read replicas** (offload analytics
and reporting queries), **connection pooling** (Supavisor, the pgBouncer
replacement, with transaction/session modes), **compute upgrades** (vCPU/RAM
tiers), **CDN for Storage** (cache public bucket assets at the edge), **Edge
Function regions** (deploy functions closer to users), and **table
partitioning** (split billion-row tables for query performance). This skill
gives the high-level workflow inline and links to `references/` for the full
`createClient` config, SQL, and CLI for each layer.

## Prerequisites

- Supabase project on a Pro plan or higher (read replicas require Pro+)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` v2+ installed
- `supabase` CLI installed and linked to your project
- Database access via `psql` or Supabase SQL Editor
- TypeScript project with generated database types

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Read Replicas and Connection Pooling

Route read-heavy queries (dashboards, reports, search) to a read replica while
keeping writes on the primary. Supavisor pools connections in two modes:
**transaction** (default, port 6543 — shares connections, no prepared
statements) and **session** (port 5432 — one connection per client, needed for
prepared statements and `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`). Configure two clients — a primary
and a read-only replica pointed at the `-ro` URL:

```typescript
// lib/supabase.ts
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL!, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!)       // writes + realtime
export const supabaseReadOnly = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.SUPABASE_READ_REPLICA_URL!, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!) // analytics
```

Then send analytics queries to `supabaseReadOnly` and all writes to `supabase`.
Replicas lag slightly (typically <100ms), so never read-after-write on a
replica. Full client config, pooled `psql` connection strings, query-routing
services, and a pool-usage monitoring query:
[read replicas and connection pooling](references/connection-pooling.md).

### Step 2 — Compute Upgrades, CDN for Storage, and Edge Function Regions

Match compute tier to traffic (Micro 60 connections → 4XL 480), serve public
Storage buckets through the CDN with long `cacheControl` headers plus
content-addressed paths for cache busting, and deploy Edge Functions to the
region closest to users:

```bash
supabase projects update --experimental --compute-size large   # scale compute
supabase functions deploy my-function --region eu-west-1        # deploy near users
```

Full compute selection table, CDN upload/transform patterns, versioned-asset
cache busting, and the regional geo-router Edge Function:
[compute, CDN, and edge regions](references/cdn-and-edge.md).

### Step 3 — Database Table Partitioning

Split large append-heavy tables (events, logs, metrics) by date range so
queries scan only the relevant partitions and old data drops cheaply. See
[table partitioning patterns](references/table-partitioning.md) for range
partitioning by date, automated partition creation via `pg_cron`, SDK query
patterns with partition-key filters, and partition drop for data retention.

## Output

- Read replica client configured for analytics/dashboard queries, primary for writes
- Connection pooling mode selected (transaction vs session) with correct port
- Compute tier matched to traffic requirements
- Storage uploads optimized with CDN cache headers and image transforms
- Edge Functions deployed to the region closest to users
- Large tables partitioned by date range with automated partition management
- Data retention policy via partition drops

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `too many connections for role` | Exceeded Supavisor pool limit | Use transaction mode (port 6543), reduce idle connections, upgrade compute |
| Read replica returns stale data | Replication lag (typically <100ms) | Do not read-after-write on replica; use primary for consistency-critical reads |
| `no partition of relation "events" found for row` | Insert date outside any partition range | Create a DEFAULT partition or pre-create future partitions |
| Storage CDN returns old file | Cached at edge | Use content-addressed paths (`hash.ext`) or set shorter `cacheControl` |
| Edge Function cold start | First request to a region | Use `keep-alive` cron ping or accept ~200ms cold start |
| `prepared statement already exists` | Transaction mode doesn't support prepared statements | Switch to session mode (port 5432) or disable prepared statements in your ORM |

## Examples

### Quick Connection Pool Check

```bash
# Check how many connections are in use right now
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT count(*) AS active_connections FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';"
```

For deeper worked examples — swapping an existing table to a partitioned one
(create/migrate/rename in a transaction) and measuring live read-replica lag —
see [advanced scaling examples](references/advanced-examples.md).
