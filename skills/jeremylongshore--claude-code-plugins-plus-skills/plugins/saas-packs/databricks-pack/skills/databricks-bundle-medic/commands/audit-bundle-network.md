# /audit-bundle-network

Audits a Databricks data-plane VPC for the D9 PrivateLink cost leak using the
`databricks-bundle-medic` skill. Enabling PrivateLink covers the control plane only —
S3, STS, and Kinesis data-plane calls still cross the NAT (billing NAT-processing +
cross-AZ transfer) until each has its own VPC endpoint.

## Usage

```text
/audit-bundle-network [--present s3,sts,kinesis] [--vpc-id <id>] [--region <region>]
```

## What it does

1. Runs `scripts/audit-vpc-endpoints.py` against the endpoints you already have.
2. Reports SAFE, or a COST LEAK finding naming each missing endpoint (S3 → free Gateway
   endpoint; STS + Kinesis → Interface endpoints) with why each service is called and
   the cost line it incurs without an endpoint.
3. Emits ready-to-fill remediation Terraform for the missing endpoints.
4. Points at `references/cost-leak-map.md` for the full per-service map and the
   Azure Private Link / GCP PSC equivalents.

Read-only — it emits a plan and Terraform; it does not change your VPC.
