# First-party Fly.io evidence

Consulted on 2026-09-13 for `flyio-cost-tuning`.

## Authority boundary

Fly.io documentation and the provider-maintained flyctl repository define platform behavior. This skill treats local examples as implementation guidance, not as an official SDK, support promise, price lock, regional-capacity guarantee, or proof that a live operation succeeded.

## Product facts applied

- Stopped or suspended Machines avoid CPU and RAM charges, but persistent resources can continue billing.
- Volumes are billed while attached or unattached, including when the Machine is stopped.
- Managed Postgres lives outside apps, so deleting an app does not delete its database.

## Maintenance rule

Re-fetch the linked first-party pages and current flyctl release before changing authentication, commands, API paths, state names, limits, deployment strategies, storage behavior, or pricing-sensitive guidance. Record the retrieval date and new fingerprints; do not silently preserve stale claims.
