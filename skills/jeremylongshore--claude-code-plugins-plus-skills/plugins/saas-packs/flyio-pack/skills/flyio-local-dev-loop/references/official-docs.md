# First-party Fly.io evidence

Consulted on 2026-09-13 for `flyio-local-dev-loop`.

## Authority boundary

Fly.io documentation and the provider-maintained flyctl repository define platform behavior. This skill treats local examples as implementation guidance, not as an official SDK, support promise, price lock, regional-capacity guarantee, or proof that a live operation succeeded.

## Product facts applied

- Private 6PN services can be reached from an authorized external peer through WireGuard or supported proxy workflows.
- Local parity must include image architecture and listening behavior, not only application tests.
- Remote development access does not authorize copying customer data into local fixtures.

## Maintenance rule

Re-fetch the linked first-party pages and current flyctl release before changing authentication, commands, API paths, state names, limits, deployment strategies, storage behavior, or pricing-sensitive guidance. Record the retrieval date and new fingerprints; do not silently preserve stale claims.
