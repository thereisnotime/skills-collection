# LangChain Enterprise RBAC - Detailed Implementation

See the full source in the SKILL.md history. Key patterns include Permission enums, Role-based User models, PermissionChecker decorators, ModelAccessController, TenantIsolationMiddleware with ContextVar, TenantScopedVectorStore, and UsageQuotaManager. All code follows the patterns documented in the original skill body.

For brevity, the core patterns are preserved in the main SKILL.md instructions. The complete implementation code (Permission enum, Role definitions, UserStore, PermissionChecker, ModelAccessController, TenantIsolationMiddleware, TenantScopedVectorStore, UsageQuotaManager) totals ~400 lines of Python and is available in the git history of this file.
