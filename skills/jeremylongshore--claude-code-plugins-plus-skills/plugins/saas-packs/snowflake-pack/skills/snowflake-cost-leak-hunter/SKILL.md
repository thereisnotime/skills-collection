# Snowflake Cost Leak Hunter

## Overview

Produce a read-only, evidence-first Snowflake cost investigation. The deterministic
analyzer emits a typed ledger whose `total`, `attribution`, `context`, `estimate`, and
`invoice-only` roles cannot silently collapse into one savings claim.

**Problem:** Cost views answer different questions, arrive at different times, and do
not equal invoice truth. Generic advice easily turns observed credits into unsupported
prices or promised savings.

**Outcome:** A reproducible review packet that identifies what the supplied evidence
confirms, what was estimated from an approved rate, what remains at risk, and what is
unknown.

## Prerequisites

- An exact account and UTC analysis window.
- Sanitized output collected by an operator through an approved read-only Snowflake
  session, or an equivalent exported evidence bundle.
- A role already authorized to read the required `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` surfaces.
- A writable local working directory for report artifacts. Use `Write` only to create
  new local evidence/report files; never use it to alter Snowflake configuration.
- A customer-supplied rate-card record if currency estimates are requested.

## Safety and evidence contract

- **Read-only Snowflake work only.** Do not execute DDL/DML, change warehouse state or
  size, alter auto-suspend, assign monitors, create budgets, change tags, or cancel
  queries. Emit proposed changes for a named owner to review.
- **Do not invoke Snowflake authentication from this skill.** The operator runs the
  bounded collection queries through an approved read-only session and supplies only
  sanitized results. Never request connection files, private keys, tokens, passwords,
  or environment values.
- **Do not require `ACCOUNTADMIN`.** Use a role already authorized to read the needed
  `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views. Visibility differs by database role and account
  configuration; report missing access rather than escalating privileges.
- **Bind every history query to an explicit UTC half-open start and end time.** Record
  session UTC offset, account/organization identity, role, query IDs, collection time,
  SQL and result hashes, row cap state, and the maximum activity timestamp returned.
  A single bundle may cover at most seven days; partition longer audits.
- **Use the fixed official latency matrix.** Apply the reviewed per-view and per-field
  cutoffs in
  [references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md](references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md);
  caller-supplied latency or maximum activity time cannot make a recent window settled.
  Compute each cutoff from the same-statement `execution_context.observed_at`, never
  the later CLI completion timestamp. A quiet source with no recent activity is not
  thereby stale.
- **Credits are not invoice truth.** Keep hourly operational credits, daily
  cloud-adjusted billed credits, and organization-currency/usage-statement evidence as
  three distinct levels. Resource monitors cover warehouses, including Adaptive
  Warehouses, but do not cover serverless features or AI services. The issued invoice
  remains authoritative. See Snowflake's
  [billing reconciliation guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/billing-reconcile).
- **No public price assumptions.** Convert credits to currency only when the user
  supplies an applicable contract/rate-card record. Such conversion remains
  `estimated` until reconciled to the billing statement.

Read [references/attribution-and-staleness.md](references/attribution-and-staleness.md)
before collecting evidence. Read
[references/warehouse-and-idle-evidence.md](references/warehouse-and-idle-evidence.md)
for the bounded SQL surfaces. If controls are requested, read
[references/controls-boundaries.md](references/controls-boundaries.md), but return a
review packet only.
For Adaptive, storage, transfer, AI, surface-denominator, and typed-ledger rules, read
[references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md](references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md).

For a live, model-neutral collection, use the shared read-only collector with an
existing Snowflake CLI profile:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/collect_snowflake_evidence.py" \
  --surface cost --connection <approved-readonly-profile> \
  --window-start <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ> \
  --window-end <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ> \
  --output /tmp/snowflake-cost-collector.json
```

Map the baseline receipt's warehouse, query, load, and generic metering datasets into
the analyzer schema. The legacy input key `serverless_usage` means generic
`METERING_HISTORY`; public labels use `metering:<SERVICE_TYPE>`. Preserve every receipt
field and reject out-of-window rows, cap uncertainty, missing integrity fields, and
unscoped fingerprints. A self-checksum proves local consistency, not Snowflake origin.

Collect needed supplemental `cost-*` surfaces with the same bounded collector and put
each complete receipt under `supplemental_receipts.<surface_inventory_name>`. Follow
[the surface contract](references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md) for the exact dataset
keys, hashes, latency cutoffs, privacy rules, and unavailable-surface behavior.

## Instructions

### 1. Fix scope before querying

Capture:

- account and role;
- half-open UTC window `[window_start, window_end)`;
- requested attribution dimension, such as warehouse, user, query tag, or service;
- whether an approved contract rate card is available;
- whether Adaptive Warehouses or serverless features are in scope.
- the complete expected-surface denominator, including storage, transfer, AI,
  resource-monitor, and budget evidence when those domains are in scope.

If the user supplies only an invoice total, state that the audit can explain usage but
cannot reconcile the invoice without the corresponding usage statement and contract
rates.

### 2. Verify access without changing grants

Have the operator run the smallest read probes with the approved connection and
provide the sanitized results. This skill does not expose the Snowflake CLI namespace.
A representative probe is:

```sql
SELECT MAX(end_time) AS max_end_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE start_time >= :window_start
  AND start_time < :window_end;
```

Probe `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` separately because its availability, latency, and
coverage differ. If either probe fails, preserve the exact sanitized error, name the
missing surface, and stop that branch. Do not propose granting broad imported
privileges automatically.

### 3. Collect normalized evidence

Use the queries and field definitions in
[references/warehouse-and-idle-evidence.md](references/warehouse-and-idle-evidence.md).
Export only the normalized fields accepted by
`scripts/analyze_cost_evidence.py`; exclude raw SQL text and credentials.

The input accepts baseline warehouse/query/load/metering arrays; supplemental
Adaptive, storage, transfer, AI, monitor, and budget evidence; optional invoice rows;
and user-supplied credit rates. Read
[the surface contract](references/cost-ledger-and-surfaces.md) for the exact keys and
overlap rules. Inventory assertions without matching receipts block completeness.

Record each source's maximum activity timestamp only as descriptive context; it does
not prove freshness, and an absent source is not zero usage. Apply the reference's
identity-disclosure contract. Never export raw users, tags, query text, notification
addresses, contract numbers, credentials, or connection values.

### 4. Run deterministic analysis

Print the canonical bundle digest in a trusted local terminal and record it separately
from the bundle. Never trust a digest copied from inside the evidence itself:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_cost_evidence.py" \
  --input cost-evidence.json --print-input-sha256
```

Then pass that separately recorded value back to the analyzer. Live receipts older
than one hour are rejected as stale transport evidence; recollect rather than relaxing
the bound.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_cost_evidence.py" \
  --input cost-evidence.json \
  --trusted-input-sha256 <recorded-sha256:hex-digest> \
  --json-out cost-analysis.json \
  --markdown-out cost-analysis.md
```

The script validates non-negative numeric evidence, sums with decimal arithmetic, and
keeps `total`, `attribution`, `context`, `estimate`, and `invoice-only` ledger roles
separate. Their additive and overlap rules are defined in the surface contract.

It does not apply magnitude thresholds, infer a price, or recommend a warehouse size.
Daily average storage snapshots must remain per day or use an explicitly labeled
average/byte-day calculation; summing multiple daily snapshots and labeling the result
`bytes` is invalid.
When query fingerprints have both attributed credits and elapsed time, it also emits
a non-dominance cost/latency Pareto view. A Pareto point is a comparison aid, not a
proof that a workload should move warehouses. Right-sizing is only a bounded review
proposal when the operator supplies the current size, explicit candidate sizes,
maximum size steps, measurement window, success criteria, and approver; never infer a
target size from credits or queue time.

### 5. Corroborate before recommending

For each ranked opportunity, record:

1. the exact source rows and time window;
2. the observed source age;
3. coverage exclusions or NULL fields;
4. a competing explanation;
5. a read-only next measurement;
6. the owner who would approve any later change.

Examples of competing explanations include intentionally warm warehouses, SLA-driven
capacity, untagged shared-service queries, or usage outside the attribution view's
coverage. Do not label those cases waste without workload-owner confirmation.

### 6. Deliver the review packet

Follow [references/output-contract.md](references/output-contract.md). Lead with the
window and coverage, not a sensational savings number. A valid packet contains:

- confirmed credits by evidence surface;
- the typed ledger with parent IDs, overlap keys, aggregation eligibility, freshness,
  availability, and invoice-reconciliation status;
- attribution completeness by warehouse, including unknown boundaries for NULL
  attribution and query coverage gaps;
- cost/latency Pareto points by query fingerprint and warehouse-load correlation;
- estimated currency in a separate table, if and only if a rate card was supplied;
- at-risk opportunities ranked by observed credits, each labeled `review required`;
- missing/late-source warnings;
- read-only verification queries;
- proposed changes in an approval queue, with no execution performed.

## Output

Return `cost-analysis.json` and `cost-analysis.md` in the user's chosen working
directory, plus the exact analyzer command used. The JSON is the machine-readable
receipt; Markdown is the human review packet. Both must contain the analysis window,
source freshness, confirmed observations, estimated amounts, at-risk opportunities,
warnings, and non-claims. Do not write runtime output into the skill directory.

## Stop conditions

Stop and return a bounded partial result when:

- authentication or the approved role fails;
- the requested window is newer than the available source timestamps;
- account and organization usage are mixed without aligned account identifiers and UTC
  boundaries;
- Adaptive Warehouse rows make warehouse attribution columns NULL;
- a required cost surface is unavailable, outside its fixed official settled window,
  truncated, region-limited, or hidden by the approved role;
- a currency request has no applicable contract rate;
- evidence contains negative credits, malformed timestamps, or incompatible currencies;
- the only proposed next step would mutate production.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Meaning | Required response |
|---|---|---|
| Approved role cannot read a required view | Coverage unavailable | Preserve the sanitized error, name the missing surface, and stop that branch without changing grants. |
| Requested end exceeds the fixed source-specific settled cutoff | Recent evidence may be incomplete | Return a partial result; do not enlarge the cutoff from a caller-supplied latency or maximum activity timestamp. |
| Attributed-query credits are NULL | Idle/unattributed calculation is unsupported for that row | Emit `COST_ADAPTIVE_ATTRIBUTION_GAP`; exclude the row from that calculation and do not substitute zero. |
| Generic AI or warehouse total and detailed attribution both exist | The evidence can overlap by design | Retain one additive total and attach AI Functions detail only beneath an account/window-aligned `AI_SERVICES` row from `METERING_HISTORY`; do not assert equality because that parent also covers Cortex Analyst. Otherwise keep the relationship unknown. |
| Storage or transfer evidence has bytes but no contract billing model | Operational context is present without price evidence | Keep bytes as `context`; do not infer currency or invoice amounts. |
| No applicable contract rate | Currency cannot be defended | Report credits only; do not substitute a public price. |
| Analyzer rejects evidence | Malformed timestamp, negative/non-finite number, or incompatible shape | Correct the input from source evidence; never coerce it into a plausible value. |
| User requests mutation | New authority and impact review are required | Return a proposed change packet and stop before execution. |

## Examples

### “Why did warehouse credits jump last week?”

Collect the two warehouse surfaces over the same UTC window. The analyzer may report
`42.5 confirmed warehouse compute credits` and `11.2 credits at risk for idle-time
review`. It must not call all 11.2 credits waste or convert them to dollars without a
supplied rate.

### “Show costs by team from QUERY_TAG”

Aggregate `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` by the existing tag. Report tagged and untagged
credits, the view's maximum timestamp, and exclusions such as idle, serverless, storage,
and cloud-services cost. Missing tags are an at-risk attribution gap, not proof of
unowned spend.

### “Create a monitor to shut down expensive warehouses”

Do not create or alter a monitor. Audit current warehouse evidence, explain the
warehouse-only coverage and suspension caveats from
[references/controls-boundaries.md](references/controls-boundaries.md), and return a
reviewable control proposal requiring explicit authorization.
