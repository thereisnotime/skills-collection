# Changelog

## v1.5.1 (2026-07-11)

Docs-only release: every SKILL.md now follows the emerging marketplace schema (8 frontmatter fields incl. `allowed-tools`/`license`/`compatibility`, plus Overview/Prerequisites/Instructions/Output/Error Handling/Examples/Resources sections). All five skills grade A (93-94/100, 0 errors) on the tonsofskills marketplace validator. Operative instructions are unchanged; descriptions gained only an additive "Trigger with '/command'." sentence.

## v1.5.0 (2026-07-09)

### Honest token costs — always-loaded vs on-demand

Only skill **descriptions** sit permanently in the system prompt; the SKILL.md body loads when a skill triggers (progressive disclosure). Every cost view now reports both numbers separately instead of implying the whole file is context rent:

- `/janitor-value` table: `Always` (description tokens) and `Body` (on-trigger tokens) columns, with an "Always-loaded TOTAL (% of budget)" summary.
- Swipe cards: `Context 213 always · 5,431 on trigger`.
- JSON adds `desc_tokens` / `body_tokens` per skill and `always_loaded_tokens` / `always_pct` totals.

### Subagents are inventoried too

Agents in `~/.claude/agents` and `./.claude/agents` have always-loaded descriptions just like skills — often costing more. `scan.sh` emits an `agents` array and `/janitor-value` reports their always-loaded total.

### Plugin update detection

`scan.sh` plugins now carry `update_available` — the installed commit compared against the marketplace clone's HEAD. `/janitor-report` can tell you which plugins are stale.

### 7x faster scan

`scan.sh` renders the whole JSON in a single python3 pass instead of ~6 processes per skill (55s → ~8s on a 175-skill machine). Paths and all fields are now properly JSON-escaped.

### Fixed

- **`/janitor-fix --prune` never actually matched broken symlinks** — the `"$dir"/*/` glob only yields entries that resolve to directories. Prune now sees and removes them; broken symlinks also appear in the scan inventory, the fix pass, and lint (whose "broken symlink" CRITICAL was unreachable for the same glob reason).
- **`--prune` died silently when a default skills dir was missing** (bare `return` propagating status 1 under `set -e` — same class as the v1.4.1 `add_dir` bug; all five occurrences fixed).
- **Fix 2 (missing closing `---`) could swallow the whole body into frontmatter** when the body contained a column-0 `key:` line (e.g. `usage: run it like this`) — the insertion-point scan is now limited to the leading frontmatter run.
- **Agents/commands double-counted when running from `$HOME`** (`./.claude/agents` is the same directory as `~/.claude/agents`) — realpath dedup added, matching the skills side.
- **Folded/multiline YAML descriptions** (`description: >` / `|`) read as empty everywhere — new shared `extract_description` helper handles block scalars for skills AND agents, so their always-loaded tokens are counted and duplicate detection sees them.
- **Skills with an empty description broke the usage parser** (a stripped trailing tab collapsed the row into the legacy column shape, putting the filesystem path in the description and skipping dedup).
- **Two physical copies of the same skill name produced duplicate swipe cards pointing at one path** (the second copy was undeletable) — the deck now joins tokencost↔scan records by realpath.
- Swipe verdict labels no longer imply body tokens are permanent context cost ("Unused + heavy on trigger — prime delete candidate"), and the apply summary reports "frees X always-loaded + Y on-trigger" instead of a misleading % of context.
- The deck builder's default output is per-process (concurrent runs clobbered a fixed `/tmp` path).
- Duplicate rows in `/janitor-value` for one skill reachable from two roots (Claude + Codex symlink installs) — deduped by realpath, scopes merged.
- GitHub search results are relevance-gated (repo must carry a skill signal in name/description/topics) and ranked by relevance before stars — searching "n8n" no longer returns firecrawl.
- `precheck` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` sent a malformed Authorization header (quoting bug) — code search on private/rate-limited repos works now.
- GNU-only `\s` in lint's seds replaced with portable `[[:space:]]` (BSD sed treated it as a literal `s`).
- `fix.sh` changelog now lives in the plugin's own `data/` dir like every other tool (previously it fabricated `~/.claude/skills/skills-janitor/`, which looked like a skill).

### Removed

- The five v1.2 deprecated aliases (`janitor-audit`, `janitor-usage`, `janitor-tokens`, `janitor-search`, `janitor-precheck`) are gone, as announced. Use `/janitor-report --brief`, `/janitor-value`, `/janitor-discover`.

## v1.4.1 (2026-07-07)

Hotfix release. A deep-dive review found bugs that made v1.2–v1.4 silently broken on most machines. If any janitor command ever exited with no output at all — this is why. Upgrade.

### Fixed

- **Every script died silently on Claude-only installs.** `paths.sh`'s `add_dir` returned non-zero when a default directory was missing (e.g. no `~/.agents/skills` because you don't use Codex), and `set -e` killed the sourcing script before it printed anything. Affected every command since v1.2.0. Also fixed the empty-array-under-`set -u` crash (bash 3.2) for machines with no skill directories at all.
- **Usage tracking looked for conversation history at a non-standard path**, so on standard installs every skill was reported "never used" — which fed the swipe deck the wrong verdicts. History is now resolved from `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/history.jsonl`, `~/.claude/history.jsonl`, then `~/.claude-account-*/history.jsonl`; a missing file degrades gracefully instead of crashing the Python stage.
- **`/janitor-fix --apply` could corrupt SKILL.md files on macOS.** BSD `sed a\` glued inserted text onto the following line (`description: "..."---`, unclosed frontmatter), and the `name:`/`description:` matchers also hit example frontmatter in skill *bodies*. All frontmatter edits now use awk, anchored to the first match inside the frontmatter only.
- **Bare plugin-skill invocations now count.** `/janitor-audit` in your history is matched to `skills-janitor:janitor-audit`; previously only the fully-qualified form counted, so plugin skills you use daily showed `0×` in `/janitor-value` and the swipe deck.
- **Empty-body detection produced `0\n0`** (`grep -c … || echo 0`) which broke an arithmetic comparison — lint silently dropped its "very little body content" warning.

### Known issues (planned for v1.5)

- `usage.sh` doesn't dedupe skills reachable from two paths (symlinked Claude+Codex installs show duplicate rows).
- Token cost reports the full SKILL.md size; only the description is always-loaded (the body loads on demand). A split cost view is planned.

## v1.4.0 (2026-05-25)

### `/janitor-swipe` — Tinder for your Claude Code skills

A new bash TUI that puts every installed skill into a sorted deck and lets you swipe `keep` / `delete` / `skip` on each one. The deck is sorted "most likely waste first" so the cards you'd actually want to delete appear at the top — most users hit `←` a few times on the heavy-and-unused entries and quit before reviewing the whole list.

The killer ratio: on a typical machine, you can reclaim 30–40% of your skill token cost in under a minute of swiping.

### What you see

Each card shows skill name, position in deck, token cost (% of context budget), usage count and last invoked date, scope, 3-line description, and a verdict label like *"Heavy + unused — likely dead weight"*. The scoring formula prioritizes high-token + zero-usage + stale-last-use combinations.

Controls follow the obvious mappings: arrows or `hjkl` for left/right/down, `u` to undo, `i` to inspect the full description, `q` to quit.

### Honest about what it can delete

User-scope, project-scope, and Codex skills get staged for actual `rm -rf` on the swiped-left list. Plugin-namespaced skills (which can't be individually deleted — they belong to a plugin) get flagged in a separate "plugins to review" section with a hint to run `/plugin uninstall <plugin>` if you swiped delete on enough of its skills. Symlinks are unlinked, never followed.

### Apply screen

After the last card (or `q`), a summary screen shows keep/skip/delete counts, the actual deletion list with paths, the plugin review breakdown, and a prompt:

- `y` — apply deletions immediately, log to `~/.skills-janitor/log.jsonl`
- `N` — cancel, no changes
- `save` — write decisions to `~/.skills-janitor/swipe-<timestamp>.json`; apply later with `swipe.sh --apply <file>`

### Why you have to run it via `!`

The TUI needs an interactive terminal for `read -rsn1` keypress capture. Inside Claude Code, the Bash tool's stdin is non-interactive, so the script detects that and prints a friendly error. The intended invocation is:

```
!bash ~/.claude/skills/skills-janitor/scripts/swipe.sh
```

The `!` prefix routes the command through your real shell, where keypresses work.

### Implementation notes

- Pure bash + python3 (same dependency footprint as the rest of the project), no TUI library
- Bash 3 compatible (macOS default) — no associative arrays, all aggregation via tempfiles
- `set -euo pipefail` throughout, terminal state restored on any exit path
- Edge cases handled: no skills installed, terminal < 50 cols or < 22 rows, no TTY, Ctrl-C mid-swipe, save-and-resume across sessions

### v1.3 aliases still working

The five v1.2 deprecated aliases (`janitor-audit`, `janitor-usage`, `janitor-tokens`, `janitor-search`, `janitor-precheck`) are unchanged. They keep working through v1.4 and will be removed in v1.5.

## v1.3.0 (2026-05-22)

### Plugin skills are now visible

The single biggest correctness fix in this project's history. Through v1.2, Janitor could only see skills under `~/.claude/skills/` (and the Codex equivalent) — plugin-namespaced skills installed via `/plugin install` (e.g. `marketing-skills:image`, `figma:figma-use`, `vercel:nextjs`) were completely invisible to every command.

v1.3 walks the active install path of every entry in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (and `~/.claude/sources/<source>/skills/` for source-loaded skills), dedups by realpath to avoid double-counting plugins installed at both user and project scope, and uses the active version only (not every cached version under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`).

Real impact on a typical machine: scanned skill count jumped from 35 → 157, token cost reporting went from "9% of budget" to "123% of budget" (i.e. the user was over their context budget without knowing it).

Affects every command:
- **`scan.sh`** — emits `namespace` and `qualified_name` fields; plugin skills appear as `<plugin>:<skill>`.
- **`detect_dupes.sh`** — surfaces cross-scope user-vs-plugin overlaps (the situation where you installed the `marketing-skills` plugin AND have a redundant user-scope `marketing-seo-audit` copy).
- **`tokencost.sh`** — plugin skills now counted toward total context cost.
- **`usage.sh`** — matches `/marketing-skills:image` style invocations against namespaced skills.

### Commands consolidated 7 → 4

- **`/janitor-report`** (default = full check, `--brief` = inventory only) replaces both `/janitor-audit` and the v1.2 `/janitor-report`.
- **`/janitor-value`** replaces `/janitor-usage` + `/janitor-tokens` — combined view sorted by waste (heavy + unused first), which is the actually-useful question.
- **`/janitor-discover`** replaces `/janitor-search` + `/janitor-precheck` — dispatches by arg shape (keyword → search, URL/path → precheck).
- **`/janitor-fix`** unchanged.

The four removed commands keep working as deprecated aliases for one release; they print a one-line rename notice and delegate to the new equivalent. Aliases will be removed in v1.4.

### Also fixed
- **`scan.sh` no longer double-counts user skills as project skills when run from `$HOME`.** Realpath dedup matches the existing logic for Codex.
- **Plugin-scope label simplified to `"plugin"`** (was previously planned as `"plugin-marketplace"/"plugin-cache"`). Plugin install scope is a property of the plugin, not the skill.
- **`for_each_skill_dir` in `paths.sh` now iterates plugin and source dirs too**, with namespace passed as a 4th callback arg. All consumers (detect_dupes, tokencost, usage, precheck) pick up plugin coverage automatically.

### Migration

| v1.2 command | v1.3 equivalent |
|---|---|
| `/janitor-audit` | `/janitor-report --brief` |
| `/janitor-usage` | `/janitor-value` |
| `/janitor-tokens` | `/janitor-value` |
| `/janitor-search <kw>` | `/janitor-discover <kw>` |
| `/janitor-precheck <url>` | `/janitor-discover <url>` |

## v1.2.0 (2026-04-29)

### Fixed (correctness)
- **`fix.sh --apply` no longer corrupts modern skills.** The repair now recognizes nested `metadata.version` (the canonical layout used by `npx skills add`), not only top-level `version:`. Without this fix, `--apply` would have injected duplicate top-level `version:` lines into every skill that already had `metadata.version`. The repair itself now writes the canonical nested form (`metadata:\n  version: "1.0.0"`) via awk so the appended block doesn't collide with the closing `---` on BSD sed (macOS).
- **`scan.sh` emits valid JSON.** Self-skip of the top-level `skills-janitor` folder previously left a dangling comma (`}\n,\n,\n{`) that broke any JSON consumer. Comma emission moved inside `scan_skill` after the early-return check.
- **`scan.sh` parses `installed_plugins.json` v2 schema.** Claude Code v2 wraps plugins in `{"version": 2, "plugins": {key: [instances]}}`; the previous parser treated it as a flat array and silently produced `"plugins": []` on every modern install. Older flat-array shape kept as a fallback.
- **`detect_dupes.sh` no longer reports symlink shadows as 100% self-duplicates.** Skills resolved to the same `realpath` (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/foo` symlinking to `~/.agents/skills/foo`) are deduped before comparison, eliminating "[100%] foo <-> foo" entries with both scopes labeled `user`.
- **`tokencost.sh` no longer double-counts symlinked skills.** Same realpath dedup; total token cost drops to the actual physical file count.

### Added
- **`detect_dupes.sh` name-collision pass.** Two distinct skill folders with the same name living at different realpaths (the situation that confuses skill triggering) are now flagged in a dedicated section, regardless of description similarity. The previous Jaccard-only check missed exact-name collisions when descriptions diverged.

### Fixed (from prior unreleased)
- **Windows compatibility** - removed dead `/dev/stdin` open in `detect_dupes.sh` that caused `FileNotFoundError` on Windows (Git Bash/MSYS2). The code was a no-op (`pass` body) and the actual data is read via `$TMPFILE` env var.
- **lint: false-positive CRITICAL for support folders** - folders without `SKILL.md` (e.g. `_shared`, `_docs`, `_temp`, plugin subdirs) are now silently skipped instead of emitting a spurious CRITICAL.
- **lint: multiline description parsing** - description values using YAML block scalars (`|`, `>`) are now collected across all indented lines via `awk`, fixing false "description too short" warnings. Long-description threshold raised from 250 → 500 chars to match real-world multi-line descriptions.
- **lint: new check for `disable-model-invocation` skills** - skills that set `disable-model-invocation: true` with a very short description now emit a WARNING, since Claude may not trigger them correctly.

### Known limitations (deferred to v1.3.0)
- Plugin-namespaced skills under `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, and `~/.claude/sources/` are still not scanned. Affected skills are invisible to audit/dupes/tokens — tracked separately.
- `usage.sh` natural-language matching is too strict and reports most skills as "never used"; tuning needs design discussion.
- `precheck.sh` URL handling fails on nested-skill repo layouts (e.g. `anthropics/skills`); robust resolver is a separate change.

## v1.1.0 (2026-04-15)

### New
- **Cross-platform support** - works with both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
- `/janitor-precheck` - check overlap before installing a new skill
- `/janitor-tokens` - show context window token cost per skill

### Changed
- `/janitor-report` now includes lint checks, duplicate detection, and broken skill findings (was separate check/duplicates/cleanup commands)
- `/janitor-fix` gains `--prune` flag for removing broken symlinks and empty dirs
- `/janitor-search` gains `--compare <name>` flag for market comparison

### Removed (merged)
- `/janitor-check` -> use `/janitor-report`
- `/janitor-cleanup` -> use `/janitor-fix --prune`
- `/janitor-duplicates` -> use `/janitor-report`
- `/janitor-compare` -> use `/janitor-search --compare <name>`

## v1.0.0 (2026-03-24)

Initial release with 9 skills: audit, duplicates, check, fix, cleanup, report, usage, search, compare.
