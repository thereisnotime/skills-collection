"""promote-to-curated.py — generate `skills/.curated/` as a rebuilt-every-run MIRROR of
the repo's best plugin skills, so skills.sh (which only crawls root `skills/`, `.curated/`,
`.experimental/` and agent dirs — NOT `plugins/**/skills/`) can surface them.

Why this exists
---------------
skills.sh indexes skills at the repository root; it does not descend into
`plugins/**/skills/`, where ~3,100 of our real skills live. Symlinks are skipped by the
skills CLI (tested); only real files under `skills/.curated/` are discovered. So the only
way to put our best plugin skills on skills.sh is a generated mirror of copies — with the
plugin skill under `plugins/**` staying the SOURCE OF TRUTH (graded in Dolt/Freshie), and
the copies rebuilt from it, never hand-edited.

Selection (decided): grade **A + B**, plugin skills only, EXCLUDING external mirrors (a
plugin root carrying a `.source.json`) so we never republish someone else's work under our
name. That is ~1,881 of our own skills.

Selection source = `freshie/grades.csv` — the TRACKED, compact export of the latest Freshie
run (`skill_path,grade,score`). We deliberately read the CSV, not `freshie/inventory.sqlite`:
the sqlite blob is git-ignored and absent in CI, but the `--check` drift gate has to run in
CI. The CSV is the same latest-run grade surface, is committed, and makes the whole pipeline
byte-reproducible between a dev box and CI's clean checkout (the same reason
`generate-readme-toc.mjs` computes its counts from `git ls-files`, not the working tree).

Defense (build mode only): the recorded grade can go stale if a source SKILL.md was edited
after the last inventory run. So each candidate is RE-GRADED in-process by the canonical
validator (`scripts/validate-skills-schema.py::validate_skill`, marketplace tier); it is
promoted only if its FRESH grade is still A or B and it parses. We gate on the grade (the
validator's holistic verdict), NOT on the marketplace ERROR list: ~52% of even A/B skills
carry non-blocking marketplace warnings/errors (missing body sections, tool-permission
nits) — the same posture their sources already have on `main`, where the full `--marketplace`
sweep runs `|| true`. Gating on zero errors would silently halve the corpus and defeat the
"maximum reach" goal. (Grade-stability drops 0 skills today and still catches a source that
regressed below B since grading.)

Copy fidelity: we copy only the GIT-TRACKED files of each source skill dir (`git ls-files`),
never the working-tree junk or a git-ignored `data/` blob. That makes a local build identical
to a CI build (a fresh checkout only has tracked files anyway) and sidesteps the
`**/skills/*/data/` .gitignore depth mismatch.

Modes
-----
  (default / build)  Wipe `skills/.curated/` and rebuild it from the current selection.
                     Writes `skills/.curated/MANIFEST.json` (the audit trail of what was
                     promoted and why). Needs the validator importable (local dev / the
                     weekly workflow after `pnpm install`); degrades to the recorded grade
                     with a loud warning if it is not.
                     Shrink floor (2026-07-14 ops review): the selection is computed
                     BEFORE anything is deleted, and the build ABORTS non-zero — mirror
                     untouched — when the new selection is empty or falls below
                     SHRINK_FLOOR_RATIO of the committed MANIFEST count. Every upstream
                     failure mode (truncated/header-only grades.csv, a validator API
                     drift making every fresh grade None) used to converge on silently
                     wiping ~1,881 skills and exiting 0. A legitimate large drop is an
                     explicit choice: pass --allow-shrink.
  --check            CI drift gate. Reads the committed MANIFEST and verifies every promoted
                     copy is byte-identical to the current git-tracked source, with no orphan
                     or missing dirs. Deterministic, git-only — no validator, no sqlite, no
                     node_modules — so it runs in a minimal CI job without false drift. Exits
                     1 on any drift (same contract as `generate-readme-toc.mjs --check`).

Usage
-----
  Requires the repository Node 20+ runtime on PATH for canonical cohort resolution.
