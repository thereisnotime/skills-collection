> **Killer Skill of the Week** — [token-optimizer](https://github.com/alexgreensh/token-optimizer) by Alex Greenshpun ([@alexgreensh](https://github.com/alexgreensh))
>
> **Ghost tokens eat your context. Find them. Fix them. Prevent rot.**
>
> Claude gets measurably dumber as your context fills. Compaction destroys 60-70% of your conversation. Ghost tokens burn through your rate limits on every message. Token Optimizer tracks all of it: live quality scoring on your status line, smart compaction that saves your decisions before they're lost, full analytics dashboard with per-session cost breakdowns, and 6 parallel audit agents that optimize your entire setup. Not a one-time scan. An ongoing intelligence layer for your Claude Code workflow.
>
> *"My Claude Code kept leaking tokens. So I built this. Now my limits last longer, context stays fresh, and I have full visibility and control over my usage & setup."* — Alex Greenshpun

**Option 1: CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
pnpm add -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
ccpi search devops              # Find plugins by keyword
ccpi install devops-automation-pack
ccpi list --installed           # See what's installed
ccpi update                     # Pull latest versions
```

**Option 2: Claude Built-in Commands**

## How Agent Skills Work

Agent Skills are instruction files (`SKILL.md`) that teach Claude Code **when** and **how** to perform specific tasks. Unlike commands that require explicit `/slash` triggers, skills activate automatically when Claude detects relevant conversation context.

### The Activation Flow

```
1. INSTALL     /plugin install ansible-playbook-creator@claude-code-plugins-plus
2. STARTUP     Claude reads SKILL.md frontmatter → learns trigger phrases
3. ACTIVATE    You say "create an ansible playbook for Apache"
4. EXECUTE     Claude matches trigger → reads full skill → follows instructions
```

### What a Skill Looks Like

```yaml
---
name: ansible-playbook-creator
description: |
  Generate production-ready Ansible playbooks. Use when automating server
  configuration or deployments. Trigger with "ansible playbook" or
  "create playbook for [task]".
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash(ansible:*), Glob
version: 2.0.0

# Ansible Playbook Creator

## Overview
Generates idempotent Ansible playbooks following infrastructure-as-code best practices.

## Instructions
1. Gather target host details and desired state
2. Select appropriate Ansible modules
3. Generate playbook with proper variable templating
4. Validate syntax with `ansible-lint`

## Output
- Complete playbook YAML ready for `ansible-playbook` execution
```

## Plugin Types

### AI Instruction Plugins (295 plugins)
Markdown files that guide Claude's behavior through structured instructions, skills, commands, and agents. No external code — everything runs through Claude's built-in capabilities.

### MCP Server Plugins (9 plugins)
TypeScript applications that run as separate Node.js processes. Claude communicates with them through the Model Context Protocol.

### SaaS Skill Packs (111 plugins across 22 pack collections)
Pre-built skill collections for specific platforms — Deepgram, LangChain, Linear, Gamma, and others. Each pack includes install/auth, core workflows, debugging, deployment, and advanced pattern skills.
