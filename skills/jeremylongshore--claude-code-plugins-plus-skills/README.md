# Tons of Skills

**A model-agnostic agent-skills platform.** The canonical layer is harness-free by construction; [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/) is the first and best-supported harness, and additional harnesses appear on this surface only when a declared, generated adapter exists — never by adjective.

## Install

Inside Claude Code, one command installs the whole marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins
```

<!-- The slug above is a FROZEN compatibility contract (blueprint § 6A.3): it is
     hardcoded in the CLI, the website Hero snippet, and hundreds of downstream
     READMEs, and GitHub's redirect to the canonical repo name is load-bearing.
     No redesign may "normalize" it to the canonical repo name. -->

Or use the CLI:

```bash
pnpm add -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
ccpi install devops-automation-pack
```

> **Killer Skill of the Week** — [no-ai-slop](https://github.com/petergyang/no-ai-slop) by [Peter Yang](https://github.com/petergyang)
>
> **Strip AI slop from any draft — named-pattern edits that keep the writer's real voice**
>
> no-ai-slop does two jobs and refuses to fake a third. In Edit mode it makes the minimum effective edit — cutting throat-clearing, weak verbs, and abstract nouns while deliberately preserving the writer's cadence, bluntness, humor, and honest admissions, so a rough draft still sounds like the same person afterward. In Detect mode it names each AI-slop pattern it finds, quotes the offending line, and gives the fix in a few words — and pointedly does NOT score the draft or guess whether an AI wrote it. That restraint is the whole point: AI detectors guess; named patterns are evidence the reader can check. MIT-licensed, single focused skill, actively maintained by Peter Yang.

## Scale, labeled

Every number below names the cohort it counts and the command that reproduces it — an unlabeled count is how a corpus ends up with five contradictory answers to "how many skills."

## Ways in

Five real questions, five doors — each resolves to a live, generated surface, never a hand-maintained list:

- **By category** — the [table below](#browse-by-category), regenerated from the catalog on every sync.
- **By plugin** — [tonsofskills.com/explore](https://tonsofskills.com/explore), the full browsable catalog.
- **By skill** — [tonsofskills.com/skills](https://tonsofskills.com/skills), searchable across the whole corpus.
- **By job to be done** — [tonsofskills.com/cowork](https://tonsofskills.com/cowork), curated bundles as one-click downloads.
- **By certification tier** — the [Certification](#certification) section below, rendered from the live report.

## Browse by category

The 19 categories below link into the live marketplace. Plugin counts are the catalog-entry cohort — regenerated from `marketplace.extended.json` by this generator; the catalog itself lives on [tonsofskills.com](https://tonsofskills.com), never in this file (§ 6A of the platform blueprint).

## What the classes mean

Four artifact classes live in this repository, distinguished on sight and never blurred — provenance is a truth requirement here, not a UX nicety:

| Class                   | What it is                                         | How the reader can tell                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Canonical skill**     | First-party, harness-free, the source of truth     | No `.source.json` in its plugin directory                                     |
| **Generated adapter**   | A thin, machine-produced harness projection        | Lives under a generated path with a "generated — do not edit" header          |
| **First-party package** | An Intent Solutions distribution (npm, cowork zip) | `@intentsolutionsio` scope, IS-authored license                               |
| **Upstream mirror**     | Somebody else's work, hosted mirror-by-default     | `.source.json` present — upstream author, license, and pinned commit recorded |

## Certification

<!-- CERTIFICATION:START — do not edit; run `node scripts/generate-readme-toc.mjs` -->

**Not yet certified.** The certification program (tiers T0–T4 with retained, hash-matched evidence) is a later epic of the platform blueprint; until its report exists, no artifact on this surface claims a tier. This line is rendered from the absence of `certification-report.json` — honestly, not cosmetically.

<!-- CERTIFICATION:END -->

## Contribute

Start with the contribution guide, then the intake and review standards every submission passes through:

- [Contribution requirements](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) — including the AI-assistance disclosure expectation.
- [Skill submission intake standard](000-docs/700-DR-GUID-skill-submission-standard.md) — the tiered document matrix new plugins ship with.
- [External-PR review standard](000-docs/709-DR-GUID-reviewing-external-prs.md) — how maintainers triage and what gets a submission merged.

## Governance

- [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) — the public spec posture and the canonical-documents index (one owner per fact class).
- [The platform master blueprint](000-docs/727-AT-ARCH-master-modernization-blueprint.md) — CI gates, release, docs governance, and this README's own landing contract.
- [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) · [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) · [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Provenance

External plugins are hosted **mirror-by-default**: the contributor's repository stays the source of truth, every mirrored source is pinned in a content lockfile, and upstream credit — author, license, resolved commit — is recorded in the mirror itself. Improvements flow by upstreaming to the author's repository, never by silently editing the mirror. The full decision record is [the external-sync model](000-docs/694-AT-DECR-external-sync-mirror-by-default-model.md).

## License

MIT for the repository scaffolding and first-party tooling; each plugin carries its own license in its manifest, and mirrored plugins keep their upstream license verbatim.
