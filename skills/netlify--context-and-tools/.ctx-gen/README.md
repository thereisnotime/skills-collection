# Context Pipeline receiver (Stage 2)

This is the **receiving** side of the [Context Pipeline](https://linear.app/netlify/issue/AX-97) (AX-97).

`netlify/docs` is the source of truth. Its `ctx-gen` distills docs into an
`agent-context/<grouping>/` intermediate and — per grouping — generates and
AXIS-tests a full skill at `agent-context/<grouping>/skill/`. When that changes,
docs notifies this repo.

This repo's job is **deterministic distribution**: pull the generated skill and
import it, byte for byte, into `skills/`. No model call, no content rewrite —
authoring and testing happen upstream, so a faithful copy is enough. (If we ever
transform content here, that's the point at which this repo would add its own
AXIS scenarios.)

## Pieces

- **`config.json`** — which docs groupings we consume and the local skill each
  maps to (`functions` → `netlify-functions`).
- **`state.json`** — a provenance log, never consulted for the skip decision.
  Per grouping we record the `manifest.generation.source_hash` and docs commit
  last imported, plus `affects` and `intermediateHash` (sha256 of the
  grouping's `context.md` + `system.md`, the inputs the skill is generated
  from). The delta itself is a byte comparison of
  `agent-context/<grouping>/skill/**` against `skills/<name>/**` (path set +
  bytes + executable bit; symlinks unsupported), so repeated dispatches of
  identical content are no-ops and upstream hand edits that never touch the
  manifest still propagate. When `intermediateHash` moves while `skill/` is
  identical, the run warns and imports nothing.
- **`../scripts/ctx-receive.mjs`** — reads the two files above against a docs
  checkout, imports changed groupings, records provenance in `state.json`.
- **`../.github/workflows/ctx-pipeline-receive.yml`** — resolves the docs ref,
  checks out docs, runs the importer, and opens or updates a single rolling
  draft PR when something changed. That PR runs the existing `validate-skills`
  and `build-generated-outputs` (cursor/codex parity) gates; a human reviews
  and merges. Rollback = revert.
- **`../.github/workflows/ctx-pipeline-notify.yml`** — a `workflow_run`
  watcher that reports every receiver outcome (imported / no-op / stale skip /
  failed / unclassified) to context-hub, which posts the Slack notice to
  `#notify-context-pipeline`. docs' dispatch is fire-and-forget, so the
  receiver's own outcome has to be reported from this side (EX-3057). Logic in
  `../scripts/ctx-notify.mjs`; inert until `CONTEXT_HUB_URL` (variable) and
  `CONTEXT_HUB_PIPELINE_KEY` (secret) exist in the `ctx-pipeline` environment.
- **Release pings** — `release-please.yml` (`notify-hub` and `report`) tells
  context-hub when a release PR opens, a release is created, and a publish
  finishes, via `../scripts/ctx-hub-ping.mjs` (EX-3255). Inert until
  `CONTEXT_HUB_URL` (variable) and `CONTEXT_HUB_PIPELINE_KEY` (secret) exist in
  the `ctx-pipeline` environment; a failed ping never blocks a release.

## Triggers

The receiver runs on docs' `agent-context-updated` dispatch or a manual
`workflow_dispatch`. docs only dispatches **after its AXIS quality gate
passes**, so an imported commit is gated by construction.

There is no scheduled catch-up poll: a missed dispatch self-heals on the next
one (each run imports the full current skill, not a delta) or is recovered with
a manual run. The dispatch trigger is armed by the `CTX_PIPELINE` repo variable;
manual runs never need it.

## One rolling PR

Imports land on a single branch (`ctx-pipeline/agent-context-sync`) as one
standing draft PR, force-updated in place as new context arrives. This avoids
overlapping PRs when a second docs change lands before the first import merges —
otherwise both would touch the same skill dirs and `state.json` and need
merge-conflict cleanup. The job concurrency group serializes runs so the branch
always has a single writer.

The sync PR is titled `fix(context)`, not `chore`. The repo squash-merges
with the PR title as the whole commit message, and release-please hides
`chore`, so a chore-titled sync would never cut a release. As `fix`, every
merged import lands in the standing Release PR as a patch bump, and merging
that PR publishes the skills and manifest to the hosted site and npm
(`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`).

## Running it locally

```bash
node scripts/ctx-receive.mjs --docs <path-to-a-netlify-docs-checkout> --dry-run
```

Drop `--dry-run` to write the import. `--skills-dir` and `--state` can point at
throwaway paths to test without touching tracked files.
