# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a **comprehensive skills library** for Claude AI and Claude Code - reusable, production-ready skill packages that bundle domain expertise, best practices, analysis tools, and strategic frameworks. The repository provides modular skills that teams can download and use directly in their workflows.

**Current Scope:** 233 production-ready skills across 9 domains with 305 Python automation tools, 424 reference guides, 25 agents, and 22 slash commands.

**Key Distinction**: This is NOT a traditional application. It's a library of skill packages meant to be extracted and deployed by users into their own Claude workflows.

```

### Skill Package Pattern

Each skill follows this structure:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Master documentation
├── scripts/              # Python CLI tools (no ML/LLM calls)
├── references/           # Expert knowledge bases
└── assets/               # User templates
```

**Design Philosophy**: Skills are self-contained packages. Each includes executable tools (Python scripts), knowledge bases (markdown references), and user-facing templates. Teams can extract a skill folder and use it immediately.

**Key Pattern**: Knowledge flows from `references/` → into `SKILL.md` workflows → executed via `scripts/` → applied using `assets/` templates.

## Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:** feature → dev → main (PR only)

**Branch Protection Active:** Main branch requires PR approval. Direct pushes blocked.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Always start from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/agents-{name}

# 3. Work and commit (conventional commits)
feat(agents): implement cs-{agent-name}
fix(tool): correct calculation logic
docs(workflow): update branch strategy

# 4. Push and create PR to dev
git push origin feature/agents-{name}
gh pr create --base dev --head feature/agents-{name}

# 5. After approval, PR merges to dev
# 6. Periodically, dev merges to main via PR
```

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- ✅ Main: Requires PR approval, no direct push
- ✅ Dev: Unprotected, but PRs recommended
- ✅ All: Conventional commits enforced

See [documentation/WORKFLOW.md](documentation/WORKFLOW.md) for complete workflow guide.
See [standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md](standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md) for commit standards.

## Development Environment

**No build system or test frameworks** - intentional design choice for portability.

**Python Scripts:**
- Use standard library only (minimal dependencies)
- CLI-first design for easy automation
- Support both JSON and human-readable output
- No ML/LLM calls (keeps skills portable and fast)

**If adding dependencies:**
- Keep scripts runnable with minimal setup (`pip install package` at most)
- Document all dependencies in SKILL.md
- Prefer standard library implementations

**Past Sprints:** See [documentation/delivery/](documentation/delivery/) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for history.

## Roadmap

**Phase 1-3 Complete:** 233 production-ready skills deployed across 9 domains
- Engineering Core (37), Engineering POWERFUL (43), Product (15), Marketing (44), PM (9), C-Level (34), RA/QM (14), Business & Growth (5), Finance (4)
- 305 Python automation tools, 424 reference guides, 25 agents, 22 commands
- Complete enterprise coverage from engineering through regulatory compliance, sales, customer success, and finance
- MkDocs Material docs site with 269+ indexed pages for SEO

See domain-specific roadmaps in each skill folder's README.md or roadmap files.

## Key Principles

1. **Skills are products** - Each skill deployable as standalone package
2. **Documentation-driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable docs
3. **Algorithm over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) vs LLM calls
4. **Template-heavy** - Provide ready-to-use templates users customize
5. **Platform-specific** - Specific best practices > generic advice

## ClawHub Publishing Constraints

This repository publishes skills to **ClawHub** (clawhub.com) as the distribution registry. The following rules are **non-negotiable**:

1. **cs- prefix for slug conflicts only.** When a skill slug is already taken on ClawHub by another publisher, publish with the `cs-` prefix (e.g., `cs-copywriting`, `cs-seo-audit`). The `cs-` prefix applies **only on the ClawHub registry** — repo folder names, local skill names, and all other tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) remain unchanged.
2. **Never rename repo folders or local skill names** to match ClawHub slugs. The repo is the source of truth.
3. **No paid/commercial service dependencies.** Skills must not require paid third-party API keys or commercial services unless provided by the project itself. Free-tier APIs and BYOK (bring-your-own-key) patterns are acceptable.
4. **Rate limit: 5 new skills per hour** on ClawHub. Batch publishes must respect this. Use the drip timer (`clawhub-drip.timer`) for bulk operations.
5. **plugin.json schema** — ONLY these fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `skills: "./"`. No extra fields.
6. **Version follows repo versioning.** ClawHub package versions must match the repo release version (currently v2.2.0+).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating dependencies between skills (keep each self-contained)
- Adding complex build systems or test frameworks (maintain simplicity)
- Generic advice (focus on specific, actionable frameworks)
- LLM calls in scripts (defeats portability and speed)
- Over-documenting file structure (skills are simple by design)

## Working with This Repository

**Creating New Skills:** Follow the appropriate domain's roadmap and CLAUDE.md guide (see Navigation Map above).

**Editing Existing Skills:** Maintain consistency across markdown files. Use the same voice, formatting, and structure patterns.

**Quality Standard:** Each skill should save users 40%+ time while improving consistency/quality by 30%+.
