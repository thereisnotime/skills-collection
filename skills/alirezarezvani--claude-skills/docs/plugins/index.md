## Plugin Structure

Every plugin follows the same minimal schema for maximum portability:

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "2.1.2",
  "author": { "name": "Author Name" },
  "homepage": "https://...",
  "repository": "https://...",
  "license": "MIT",
  "skills": "./"
}
```

!!! info "ClawHub Registry"
    Plugins are distributed via [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) as the public registry. The `cs-` prefix is used only when a slug is already taken by another publisher — repo folder names remain unchanged.

### Directory Layout

## Compatibility Matrix

| Platform | Bundle Install | Standalone Install | Slash Commands | Agents |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Claude Code** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: |
| **OpenAI Codex** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |
| **Gemini CLI** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |
| **OpenClaw** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |

!!! tip "Full feature support"
    Slash commands (like `/pw:generate`) and agent spawning (like `cs-engineering-lead`) are Claude Code features. On other platforms, the underlying skills and Python tools work — just without the command/agent wrappers.

## FAQ

??? question "What's the difference between a bundle and a standalone plugin?"
    **Bundles** install all skills in a domain (e.g., `marketing-skills` installs all 43 marketing skills). **Standalone** plugins install a single skill or toolkit (e.g., `pw` installs just Playwright Pro). Standalone plugins are subsets of their parent bundle — installing both is safe but redundant.

??? question "Can I install multiple plugins?"
    Yes. Plugins are designed to coexist without conflicts. Each skill is self-contained with no cross-dependencies.

??? question "Do plugins require API keys or paid services?"
    No. All Python tools use stdlib only. Some skills reference external services (AWS, Google Workspace, Stripe) but follow a BYOK (bring-your-own-key) pattern — you use your own accounts.

??? question "How do I update plugins?"
    Re-run the install command. Plugins follow semantic versioning aligned with the repository releases (currently v2.1.2).

??? question "What is ClawHub?"
    [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) is the public registry for Claude Code plugins. Think of it like npm for AI agent skills. The `cs-` prefix is used only when a plugin slug conflicts with another publisher.

??? question "Can I use skills without installing anything?"
    Yes. We have [6 Custom GPTs for ChatGPT](../custom-gpts.md) that package Agent Skills into a conversational interface — no installation, no API keys. Just click and chat.
