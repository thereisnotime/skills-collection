## The Problem

Simulation engineers repeat the same guidance to AI agents constantly: *"Check the CFL number before running," "Use Richardson extrapolation for grid convergence," "Exit code 2 means bad input."* General-purpose agents lack the domain knowledge to run reliable numerical simulations without heavy hand-holding.

## The Solution

This project packages that domain knowledge into **skills** -- structured folders of instructions, scripts, and references that agents discover automatically and load on demand. Each skill teaches an agent a specific simulation competency, backed by validated Python scripts that produce reproducible results.

```text
You: Check if dt=0.001 is stable for my advection problem with v=2.0 m/s and dx=0.01.

Agent: I'll use the numerical-stability skill to check this.
       [runs cfl_checker.py --dx 0.01 --dt 0.001 --velocity 2.0 --json]

       CFL number = 0.2 (limit: 1.0) -- stable.
       Recommended max dt = 0.005 with safety factor 1.0.
```

No prompt engineering. No copy-pasting formulas. The agent finds the right skill, runs the script, and interprets the results.

## How Skills Work

Skills follow the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Each skill is a folder with three tiers of content, loaded progressively to keep context efficient:

```
skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability/
    SKILL.md              # Instructions + YAML metadata (loaded when skill triggers)
    scripts/              # Python CLI tools (executed for reproducible results)
        cfl_checker.py
        von_neumann_analyzer.py
        matrix_condition.py
        stiffness_detector.py
    references/           # Deep domain knowledge (loaded only when needed)
        stability_criteria.md
        common_pitfalls.md
        scheme_catalog.md
    evals/                # Evaluation suite per agentskills.io spec
        evals.json        # Test cases with prompts, assertions, expected outputs
    CHANGELOG.md          # Version history
```

1. **Discovery** -- The agent sees each skill's name and description at startup (~100 tokens per skill)
2. **Activation** -- When a task matches, the agent loads the full `SKILL.md` with decision guidance, workflows, and CLI examples
3. **Execution** -- Scripts run as subprocesses with `--json` output for structured, parseable results

All scripts are standalone CLI tools with `--help`, a pure-function core for testing, and consistent error handling (exit code 2 for bad input, 1 for runtime errors).

---

## Security

All skills are hardened against the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/), with 75 dedicated security tests. Key safeguards:

- **No shell access by default** -- Skills use `allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob` (no `Bash`), preventing the agent from executing arbitrary commands when processing untrusted data
- **Input validation at every boundary** -- Numeric parameters are bounds-checked and validated as finite; string inputs (parameter names, field names, term names) are validated against regex allowlists
- **Safe file loading** -- All JSON/CSV/NPY loaders enforce file size limits (100-500 MB) and structure validation (dict root required); `np.load()` uses `allow_pickle=False`
- **No `eval()`/`exec()`** -- Region condition parsing uses strict regex matching, never dynamic code execution
- **Prompt injection resistance** -- String values extracted from external files are truncated and stripped of control characters before surfacing to the agent; phase names from logs are sanitized
- **Command construction safety** -- `shlex.quote()` escapes paths interpolated into shell commands; command templates are validated against a shell-operator denylist
- **ReDoS prevention** -- User-supplied regex patterns are length-capped and checked for catastrophic backtracking constructs

Each skill documents its specific safeguards in a **Security** section within its `SKILL.md`, with standardized subsections for Input Validation, File Access, Tool Restrictions, and Safety Measures.

### Security Risk Tiers

Every skill is classified by its tool access surface:

| Tier | Criteria | Skills |
|------|----------|-------|
| **HIGH** | Has `Bash` (can execute scripts) | 9 skills — numerical-stability, time-stepping, convergence-study, differentiation-schemes, nonlinear-solvers, ontology-explorer, ontology-validator, simulation-validator, slurm-job-script-generator |
| **MEDIUM** | Has `Write` but no `Bash` | 7 skills — linear-solvers, mesh-generation, numerical-integration, parameter-optimization, performance-profiling, post-processing, simulation-orchestrator |
| **LOW** | Read/Grep/Glob only | 1 skill — ontology-mapper |

---

## Quality & Evaluation

Every skill includes an evaluation suite (`evals/evals.json`) following the [agentskills.io evaluation spec](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills). Each suite contains 4-5 test cases with realistic prompts, expected outputs, and verifiable assertions.

**Current metrics:** 78 eval test cases | 312 assertions | All 17 skills evaluated

The CI pipeline validates:
- SKILL.md frontmatter (name, description < 1024 chars, metadata block)
- Eval suite completeness (every skill has evals.json with ≥ 3 test cases)
- Security section presence (all skills must have `## Security`)
- Changelog existence (all skills must have CHANGELOG.md)

## Adding Skills to Your Agent

These skills follow the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) and work across 20+ AI coding tools. Choose your agent below.

### Claude Code

Copy individual skills (or the whole `skills/` tree) into your personal or project skills directory:

```bash
# Personal (available across all projects)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability ~/.claude/skills/numerical-stability

# Project-level (committed to version control)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability .claude/skills/numerical-stability
```

Or clone the whole repo and point Claude Code at it with `--add-dir`:

```bash
claude --add-dir /path/to/materials-simulation-skills/skills
```

Verify with: `What skills are available?` or type `/` to see skills in the autocomplete menu.

See the [Claude Code skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for more details.

### Gemini CLI

Install directly from the repo, or copy skills into your Gemini skills directory:

```bash
# User-scoped (available across all workspaces)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability ~/.gemini/skills/numerical-stability

# Workspace-scoped (project-specific)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability .gemini/skills/numerical-stability
```

Verify with: `gemini skills list`

See the [Gemini CLI skills docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/) for more details.

### OpenAI Codex

Copy skills into one of the Codex skills directories:

```bash
# User-scoped
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability ~/.agents/skills/numerical-stability

# Repository-scoped
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability .agents/skills/numerical-stability
```

Restart Codex after adding skills. Use `/skills` or `$` to invoke skills by name.

See the [Codex skills docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) for more details.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Copy skills into your workspace or personal skills directory:

```bash
# Workspace (committed to version control)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability .github/skills/numerical-stability

# Personal (across all workspaces)
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability ~/.copilot/skills/numerical-stability
```

Type `/skills` in the chat input to see and invoke available skills.

See the [VS Code skills docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) for more details.

### Cursor

Copy skills into a `skills/` directory at your project root:

```bash
cp -r skills/core-numerical/numerical-stability skills/numerical-stability
```

Cursor's MCP server auto-discovers skills from the `skills/` directory.

### Other Agents

Any agent that supports the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) can use these skills. The general pattern:

1. Copy the skill directory (containing `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`) into your agent's skills folder
2. The agent discovers the skill by its `name` and `description` in the YAML frontmatter
3. Mention the skill by name or ask a task that matches its description

```text
Use numerical-stability to check a proposed dt for my phase-field run.
```

The agent loads the skill's instructions, runs the appropriate scripts, and interprets the results.
