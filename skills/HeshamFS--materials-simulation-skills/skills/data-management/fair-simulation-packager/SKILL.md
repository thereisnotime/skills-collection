# FAIR Simulation Packager

## Goal

Build a minimal reproducibility manifest for materials simulation results so another person or agent can understand what was run, with which inputs, and how outputs should be interpreted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external dependencies
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Inputs to Gather

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Project name | Human-readable bundle name | `al-cu-diffusion-study` |
| Engine | Simulation code | `LAMMPS`, `VASP`, `MOOSE` |
| Input files | Files needed to rerun | `in.lammps,data.lmp` |
| Output files | Files needed to verify results | `log.lammps,traj.dump` |
| Structure ID | Database or local identifier | `mp-149` |
| Units | Field/unit mapping | `energy=eV,length=angstrom` |

## Decision Guidance

- Always include input files, output files, code version, and units.
- Include hashes for every file that exists locally.
- Include structure identifiers when using Materials Project, NOMAD, OPTIMADE, CIF, POSCAR, or internal database records.
- Record missing files as warnings instead of silently dropping them.

## Script Outputs

`scripts/fair_packager.py --json` prints an envelope with two top-level keys:

- `inputs`: the parsed CLI arguments echoed back (note: `inputs.inputs` is the raw
  comma-separated string passed via `--inputs`, not the per-file records).
- `results`: contains a single key `manifest`.

`results.manifest` contains these fields:

- `project_name`, `engine`, `engine_version`, `structure_id`, `units`
- `file_inventory` with `inputs` and `outputs`, each a list of per-file records
  (`path`, `exists`, and when the file exists, `size_bytes` and `sha256`)
- `missing_files`: paths that do not exist on disk
- `provenance` (`working_directory`, `manifest_schema`)
- `fair_checks`: `has_inputs`, `has_outputs`, `has_units`, `has_engine_version`, and
  `has_hashes_for_existing_files` (`true`/`false`, or `null` when no files exist so the
  check is not applicable)
- `recommended_next_steps`

Parse fields at `results.manifest.<field>`. When `--out PATH` is given, only the bare
`manifest` object (not the `inputs`/`results` envelope) is written to `PATH`.

## Workflow

```bash
python3 skills/data-management/fair-simulation-packager/scripts/fair_packager.py \
  --project-name al-cu-diffusion \
  --engine LAMMPS \
  --inputs in.lammps,data.lmp \
  --outputs log.lammps,traj.dump \
  --units energy=eV,length=angstrom,time=ps \
  --structure-id local:alcu-cell-001 \
  --json
```

Use `--out manifest.json` only when the user wants a manifest file written.

## Error Handling

Missing files are reported in `missing_files` (exit code 0). Invalid input stops with
exit code 2: malformed unit entries, fields containing control characters, fields longer
than 4096 characters, more than 1000 input or output entries, or a file larger than
500 MB. Note that ordinary file paths — including absolute paths and paths containing
`..` — are accepted and inventoried; the tool reads file contents only to compute
metadata and SHA-256 hashes.

## Limitations

This skill creates a metadata manifest. It does not upload to NOMAD, Materials Project, or an OPTIMADE provider.

## Security

### Input Validation

- `--project-name` and `--engine` are required and must be non-empty after stripping
  whitespace; an empty value stops with exit code 2.
- `--project-name`, `--engine`, `--structure-id` (when given), and every file path are
  checked for control characters (`ord < 32`) and a 4096-character maximum length; either
  condition stops with exit code 2.
- `--inputs` and `--outputs` are split on commas and capped at 1000 entries each; more
  entries stop with exit code 2.
- `--units` entries must be `key=value`; both the key and the value must match the
  allowlist `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:/@+-]+$`. A missing `=` or a non-matching key/value stops with
  exit code 2.
- There are no numeric inputs, so no finite/positive numeric checks are performed.

### File Access

- The script reads each existing input/output file in 1 MB chunks to compute its
  `size_bytes` and SHA-256 hash; files that do not exist are recorded but not read.
- A file larger than 500 MB stops with exit code 2 before it is hashed.
- The script writes no files unless `--out PATH` is given, in which case it writes exactly
  one file (the bare manifest JSON) to that path; otherwise all output goes to stdout.
- Paths are not sandboxed: absolute paths and paths containing `..` are accepted for both
  the inventoried files and `--out`. If `--out` points outside the working directory, the
  file is written there as requested.

### Tool Restrictions

- `Bash` is used to run the bundled `scripts/fair_packager.py`.
- `Read`, `Write`, `Grep`, and `Glob` are declared so the skill can inspect the working
  directory and read or write manifest/metadata files when guiding the user; they are not
  invoked by the script itself, which performs all of its own file I/O directly.

### Safety Measures

- No `eval`, `exec`, `os.system`, or `subprocess` calls; the script does not shell out and
  parses arguments with `argparse`.
- Output is emitted as JSON via `json.dumps` (or a short plain-text summary without
  `--json`).
- DoS caps bound resource use: 500 MB per file, 1000 entries per input/output list, and
  4096 characters per field.

## Version History

- 1.2.0: Made eval cases discriminating by pinning the script's exact `--json`
  output (per-file `sha256`/`size_bytes`, `units`, `structure_id`, `engine_version`,
  `missing_files`, and the tri-state `has_hashes_for_existing_files`) against
  committed `evals/files/` fixtures.
- 1.1.0: Documented the real `--json` envelope shape; made
  `has_hashes_for_existing_files` tri-state (`null` when no files exist); added entry-count
  (1000) and field-length (4096) caps; corrected the Error Handling and Security wording
  to describe actual path behavior.
- 1.0.0: Initial FAIR simulation packaging skill.
