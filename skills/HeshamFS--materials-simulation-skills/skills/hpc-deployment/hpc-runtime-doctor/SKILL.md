  Diagnose HPC runtime and scheduler problems for materials simulations,

  mismatch. Use when an ALREADY-SUBMITTED job failed, ran slowly, got killed, or
  behaved differently on a cluster than on a workstation. To author or vet a NEW
  submission script before running, use slurm-job-script-generator instead.

# HPC Runtime Doctor

## Goal

Turn cluster symptoms into a resource-layout diagnosis, environment checklist, and safe retry plan.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external dependencies
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Inputs to Gather

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Scheduler | SLURM, PBS, LSF, local | `slurm` |
| Nodes/tasks/threads | Runtime layout | `2 nodes, 128 tasks, 2 threads` |
| GPUs | Total (whole-job) GPUs via `--gpus`, or per node via `--gpus-per-node` | `--gpus 4` or `--gpus-per-node 1` |
| Symptoms | Observed failure | `oom,killed,slow-gpu` |
| MPI/OpenMP/GPU use | Parallel modes | `mpi+openmp+gpu` |
| Walltime | Requested time | `12:00:00` |
| Scratch | Whether scratch is used | `true` |

## Decision Guidance

- Check resource layout before changing physics settings.
- Confirm module/compiler/MPI/CUDA consistency before debugging solver behavior.
- Treat missing restart files and scratch cleanup as workflow failures, not physics failures.
- For GPU jobs, confirm the executable was built with the requested accelerator backend.

## Script Outputs

`scripts/hpc_runtime_doctor.py` emits:

- `resource_layout` (includes `tasks_per_node`, `total_cpus`, total `gpus`, and `gpus_per_node`)
- `diagnoses`
- `environment_checks`
- `retry_plan`
- `scheduler_notes`
- `warnings` (layout flags such as ranks-per-GPU oversubscription, OpenMP/thread mismatch, and uneven task placement)

In default (non-JSON) mode the script also prints the resource-layout summary, any
`warnings`, environment checks, and retry plan, so the most actionable items are never hidden.

## Workflow

`--gpus` is the **total** (whole-job) GPU count. Use `--gpus-per-node` (SLURM
`--gres=gpu:N` semantics) when you know the per-node allocation; total GPUs are then
`gpus_per_node * nodes` and it overrides `--gpus`.

```bash
python3 skills/hpc-deployment/hpc-runtime-doctor/scripts/hpc_runtime_doctor.py \
  --scheduler slurm \
  --nodes 2 \
  --tasks 128 \
  --cpus-per-task 2 \
  --gpus 4 \
  --symptoms oom,slow-gpu \
  --uses-mpi \
  --uses-openmp \
  --uses-gpu \
  --json
```

The example above shares 128 ranks across 4 GPUs (32 ranks/GPU), so the
`warnings` list surfaces `Many MPI ranks per GPU (32.0 ranks/GPU) may reduce GPU
efficiency.` The ranks-per-GPU check uses total ranks over total GPUs, so it fires
correctly on multi-node jobs (the threshold is 16 ranks/GPU).

## Error Handling

Invalid resource counts stop with exit code 2. Unknown symptoms are preserved as custom items for human review.

## Limitations

This skill does not query a live scheduler. It diagnoses from the submitted layout and symptoms.

## Security

### Input Validation

- Inputs are scalar CLI values and booleans only; there is no free-form code path.
- Resource counts (`--nodes`, `--tasks`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--gpus`, `--gpus-per-node`)
  are validated as integers (booleans rejected), required to be non-negative and finite,
  and capped at 1,000,000. `--nodes`, `--tasks`, and `--cpus-per-task` must additionally
  be at least 1. Out-of-range, non-integer, or zero values exit with code 2.
- The `--symptoms` string is capped at 64 comma-separated entries of at most 64 characters
  each; `--walltime` is capped at 32 characters. Oversized input exits with code 2.
- Symptoms are split, trimmed, and lower-cased. Unknown symptoms are not rejected: they are
  preserved as `custom` diagnoses for human review.
- `--scheduler` is accepted as a free-form string and is not checked against an allowlist;
  it is only echoed back in the resource layout.

### File Access

- The script reads and writes no files. All I/O is CLI args in and stdout out
  (indented JSON with `--json`, otherwise a human-readable summary); errors go to stderr.
- Because no paths are accepted or opened, there is no filesystem traversal surface and no
  path-sandboxing concern.

### Tool Restrictions

- `allowed-tools` is `Read, Bash, Write, Grep, Glob`.
- `Bash` is used only to run the bundled `scripts/hpc_runtime_doctor.py`.
- `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob` are used to inspect the skill's own files and any logs or
  submission scripts the user points at; `Write` is used to record diagnosis notes or a
  retry plan when asked.

### Safety Measures

- No `eval`, `exec`, `os.system`, or `subprocess`; the script does not launch a scheduler
  or any external process and does not inspect environment variables.
- Argument parsing is handled by `argparse`, and machine-readable output is emitted as JSON.
- DoS exposure is bounded by the resource-count cap (1,000,000), the symptom caps
  (64 entries x 64 characters), and the walltime cap (32 characters).

## Version History

- 1.1.1: Discriminating evals -- each case now pins the script's specific output
  (exact ranks-per-GPU warning, diagnosis categories, resource-layout fields) via
  deterministic `script_checks`.
- 1.1.0: Unit-consistent ranks-per-GPU warning (total ranks / total GPUs), new
  `--gpus-per-node` argument, integer `tasks_per_node` with an uneven-placement warning,
  full human-readable (non-JSON) output, and input caps for resource counts, symptoms,
  and walltime.
- 1.0.0: Initial HPC runtime diagnosis skill.
