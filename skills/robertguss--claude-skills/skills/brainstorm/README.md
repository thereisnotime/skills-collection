# Brainstorm

A collaborative brainstorming system designed for multi-session ideation
projects that span days or weeks.

## Philosophy

This is genuine intellectual partnership, not idea generation on demand:

- Claude brings observations and suggestions proactively
- Pushes back directly on weak reasoning or blind spots
- Surfaces connections to other projects (in connected mode)
- Asks hard questions the user might avoid
- Logs reasoning and disagreements for future reference

## Session Flow

**Session Start** — Claude asks:

1. New or continuing project?
2. Deep exploration or quick progress today?
3. Connected mode (cross-project awareness) or clean-slate mode (fresh
   thinking)?
4. Confirms the brainstorming context and recommends appropriate methods

**During Session:**

- Proactively offers observations: "I notice you keep circling back to X—want to
  dig into why?"
- Challenges weak reasoning: "I'm not convinced by that reasoning. Here's
  why..."
- Marks decision points: "This feels like a decision point. Should we log:
  [decision]?"
- Suggests methods when stuck or needs structure
- Captures parking lot ideas for other projects

**Session End:**

- Exit summary with current state, decisions made, open questions
- The overnight test: "What question should you sit with before our next
  session?"
- Generates versioned project document

## Idea Maturity Tracking

Each idea is tracked through maturity levels:

| Level      | Meaning                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Raw        | Just captured, unexamined            |
| Developing | Being explored, has potential        |
| Refined    | Shaped, tested, ready for evaluation |
| Ready      | Decision made, ready to execute      |
| Parked     | Not now, but worth keeping           |
| Eliminated | Killed, with documented reasoning    |
