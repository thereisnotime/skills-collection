# Research Output Format Standard

Standard format for deep research outputs to ensure consistency, usability, and
quality across Claude and Gemini research sessions.

---

## Why Standardization Matters

Without a standard format:

- Research outputs vary wildly in structure
- Important elements may be missing
- Validation is harder
- Synthesis is inconsistent
- Information gets lost

With a standard format:

- Every output has the same backbone
- Validation knows where to look
- Outputs can be compared consistently
- Synthesis is systematic
- Critical elements are never missing

---

## The Standard Structure

### Required Core Elements (Always Present)

Every research output MUST include these sections in this order:

```markdown
## Gap Identification

## Summary of Findings

## Key Evidence

## Source List

## Confidence Assessment

## Synthesis Statement
```

### Conditional Elements (Include When Applicable)

Include these sections when relevant content exists:

```markdown
## Case Studies / Examples

## Statistics / Data

## Expert Quotes

## Historical Background

## Counterarguments & Tensions

## Contradictions Between Sources

## Unexpected Discoveries

## Visual / Data Opportunities

## Connections to Other Chapters
```

---

  uncertainty
