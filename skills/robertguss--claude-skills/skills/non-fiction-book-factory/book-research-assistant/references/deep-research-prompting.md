# Deep Research Prompting

Best practices for getting quality research output from Claude and Gemini deep
research modes.

---

## Understanding Deep Research

### What It Does

Deep research modes (Claude's extended thinking with web access, Gemini's Deep
Research) allow LLMs to:

- Search the web for current information
- Read and synthesize multiple sources
- Spend extended time on complex questions
- Produce comprehensive research reports

### What It Doesn't Do

- Access paywalled academic databases directly
- Verify its own citations with 100% accuracy
- Guarantee source recency or availability
- Replace expert human judgment

---

## Prompt Structure Principles

### 1. Context First, Question Second

**Why:** LLMs perform better when they understand the context before the ask.

**Structure:**

```
[Who you are and what you're doing]
[What the book is about]
[What this chapter needs]
[The specific question]
[How you'll use the answer]
```

### 2. Be Explicit About Everything

Don't assume the model will infer what you need. Specify:

- What type of evidence you want
- How much depth
- What format for the output
- What sources to prioritize
- What to avoid

### 3. Constrain Appropriately

**Too open:** "Tell me about productivity" **Too narrow:** "Find the exact page
number where Luhmann first mentioned..." **Just right:** "What evidence from
peer-reviewed sources supports the claim that linking notes improves recall
compared to linear note-taking?"

## Key Prompt Elements

### Calibrating Depth

Be explicit about how much you need:

**Light touch:**

> "I need a brief overview with 2-3 key sources—this is supporting context, not
> a central argument."

**Medium depth:**

> "I need solid evidence from multiple sources—this supports a significant claim
> in the chapter."

**Deep dive:**

> "This is a cornerstone claim of the book. I need comprehensive research:
> multiple studies, expert perspectives, counterarguments, and the strongest
> available evidence."

### Specifying Source Quality

Tell the model what sources to prioritize:

> "Prioritize in this order: (1) peer-reviewed research, (2) primary sources
> like original documents or firsthand accounts, (3) reputable journalism from
> established publications, (4) expert commentary. Avoid: forums, content farms,
> and sources without clear authorship."

### Requesting Verification Transparency

Ask the model to distinguish what it's certain about:

> "For each source you cite, indicate whether you (a) actually retrieved and
> read it during this research session, or (b) are drawing on training
> knowledge. Flag any citations you're uncertain about."

### Handling Controversy

For contested topics:

> "This topic is contested. Present the strongest arguments on multiple sides
> rather than settling on one position. If experts disagree, show me the
> disagreement rather than resolving it artificially."

## Model-Specific Considerations

### Claude Deep Research

**Strengths:**

- Strong reasoning about complex topics
- Good at following structured output formats
- Tends to acknowledge uncertainty

**Optimize by:**

- Providing detailed output format specifications
- Asking for explicit confidence assessments
- Requesting structured analysis

**Watch for:**

- May be overly cautious about claims
- Can sometimes hedge when you need a clear answer

### Gemini Deep Research

**Strengths:**

- Strong web search and retrieval
- Often finds recent sources
- Good at comprehensive coverage

**Optimize by:**

- Specifying recency requirements clearly
- Asking for source diversity
- Requesting specific evidence types

**Watch for:**

- May prioritize coverage over depth
- Citation format may need cleanup

## Common Prompting Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Context

❌ "Research the note-taking claim from earlier" ✅ "Research the claim that
handwritten notes improve retention compared to typed notes. The book argues
[thesis] and this chapter [purpose]..."

### 2. Vague Evidence Requests

❌ "Find some evidence for this" ✅ "Find peer-reviewed studies, specific
statistics, and expert quotes that support or challenge this claim"

### 3. Missing Output Format

❌ "Tell me what you find" ✅ "Structure your response with: Summary (2-3
paragraphs), Key Evidence (bulleted with citations), Sources (full Chicago
citations with verification flags)"

### 4. No Scope Limits

❌ "Research everything about productivity" ✅ "Focus specifically on
productivity in knowledge work contexts, particularly research and writing. I
don't need manufacturing or sales productivity."

### 5. Forgetting Counterarguments

❌ "Find evidence that supports [my claim]" ✅ "Find evidence for and against
[claim]. Present the strongest counterarguments, not just supporting evidence."

## Handling Specific Research Needs

### Finding Statistics

> "I need specific statistics on [topic]. For each statistic, provide: the exact
> number, the source, the methodology (sample size, year, population), and any
> caveats about interpretation."

### Finding Case Studies

> "I need real-world examples of [phenomenon]. For each example, provide: the
> name of the organization/person, specific details of what happened, outcomes
> or results, and a source I can verify."

### Finding Expert Opinions

> "Who are the leading experts on [topic]? For each expert, provide: their
> credentials, their main position on this issue, a direct quote if available,
> and where I can find more of their work."

### Finding Historical Origins

> "What is the history of [concept/practice]? Provide: origin date and context,
> key figures involved, how it evolved, and primary sources where possible."

### Finding Counterarguments

> "What are the strongest arguments against [claim]? Steelman the
> opposition—present the best case against this position, not a strawman.
> Include evidence that supports the counterargument."

---

## Iterative Research Strategy

### First Pass: Landscape Scan

Ask for a broad overview to understand the territory:

> "Give me an overview of the research landscape on [topic]. What are the major
> schools of thought? Key debates? Foundational studies? I'll follow up with
> specific questions."

### Second Pass: Targeted Dives

Based on the landscape, drill into specific areas:

> "Based on the overview, I want to go deeper on [specific aspect]. Find the
> strongest evidence for [specific claim]."

### Third Pass: Gap Filling

Address what's missing:

> "The research so far has covered X and Y, but I still need evidence for Z.
> Focus specifically on Z."

---

## Quality Control in Prompts

### Request Self-Assessment

> "After presenting your findings, assess: How confident are you in these
> conclusions? What are the limitations of this research? What questions remain
> unanswered?"

### Request Source Diversity

> "Don't rely on a single source for major claims. I want to see corroboration
> from independent sources where possible."

### Request Conflict Flagging

> "If you find sources that disagree with each other, flag the conflict
> explicitly. Don't smooth over disagreements."

### Request Recency Check

> "Prioritize recent sources (last 3-5 years) for [fast-moving topic]. For each
> older source, note whether more recent work has confirmed, challenged, or
> superseded it."

## Prompt Template Integration

The research-assistant's prompt template (see
`assets/templates/research-prompt-template.md`) incorporates these principles.
Each section serves a specific purpose:

1. **Book/Chapter Context** → Prevents generic answers
2. **Specific Question** → Focuses the research
3. **Evidence Type** → Gets the right kind of evidence
4. **Scope/Boundaries** → Prevents scope creep
5. **Source Requirements** → Ensures citation quality
6. **Quality Criteria** → Sets the bar for "enough"
7. **Search Guidance** → Improves retrieval
8. **Special Requests** → Gets quotes, counterarguments, etc.
9. **Output Format** → Ensures usable structure

## When Research Falls Short

If research output is inadequate:

### Coverage Problem

_Research didn't address the question_ → Rephrase question more specifically →
Break into smaller sub-questions

### Depth Problem

_Not enough evidence_ → Explicitly ask for more sources → Specify "I need at
least X studies/examples"

### Quality Problem

_Sources are weak_ → Specify source hierarchy more explicitly → Ask for
peer-reviewed or primary sources specifically

### Format Problem

_Output is hard to use_ → Provide explicit output format → Ask for specific
sections

Use the follow-up prompt template
(`assets/templates/follow-up-prompt-template.md`) to address specific
deficiencies.

_Use these principles when generating research prompts and when troubleshooting
inadequate research results._
