## Skills

### 1. Book Ideation

**Purpose:** Transform raw ideas and brainstorm material into a structured Book
Concept Document.

**Use when:** You have a book idea, brainstorm documents to refine, or need to
articulate your book's core elements before validation.

**Core Elements Developed:**

- The Reader (who specifically)
- Transformation (before/after state)
- Thesis (the central argument)
- Author Angle (why you)
- Stakes (why it matters now)
- Key Concepts (the intellectual framework)
- Enemy (what you're arguing against)
- Promise (the headline claim)

**Output:** Book Concept Document

---

### 2. Book Idea Validator

**Purpose:** Stress-test book concepts against existing research before
committing to architecture.

**Use when:** You have a Book Concept Document and want to verify your thesis is
defensible and understand the competitive intellectual landscape.

**What it does:**

- Two-layer research model (landscape scan + deep dive)
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses
- Surfaces "kill signals" if they exist
- Functions as a critical intellectual partner, not a yes-man

**Output:** Validation Report with Go/Revise/Kill recommendation

---

### 3. Book Market Research

**Purpose:** Assess commercial viability of book concepts for Amazon KDP
self-publishing.

**Use when:** You have a Book Concept Document and want to understand market
demand, competition, pricing, and positioning before committing to write.

**What it does:**

- Separates commercial viability from intellectual merit
- Accounts for author intent (income vs. authority vs. passion)
- Offers quick assessment or deep dive modes
- Weighted viability scorecard (1-10 scale across 8 criteria)

**Output:** Market Research Report with Go/Conditional Go/Revise/Kill
recommendation

---

### 4. Book Architect

**Purpose:** Design the structural and emotional architecture for your book once
the concept is validated.

**Use when:** You have a validated concept and need to create the blueprint
before drafting.

**What it does:**

- Maps the reader's journey through the book
- Creates chapter-level blueprints with hooks and emotional arcs
- Every structural decision justified by reader experience
- Identifies research gaps to fill before drafting

**Outputs:**

- Master Architecture Document
- Section Blueprints
- Research Gaps Document

---

### 5. Book Research Assistant

**Purpose:** Plan, orchestrate, and validate deep research for nonfiction books
before outlining chapters.

**Use when:** You have completed book architecture and need to fill research
gaps before drafting.

**What it does:**

- Reviews and expands research gaps from book-architect
- Generates self-contained research prompts for Claude and Gemini
- Validates research outputs gap by gap
- Produces chapter summaries and final synthesis

**Outputs:**

- Book-Level Research Tracker
- Chapter Research Trackers
- Research Prompt Files
- Chapter Research Summaries
- Final Research Synthesis

---

### 6. Chapter Architect

**Purpose:** Plan and architect a single chapter at beat-level granularity
before drafting.

**Use when:** You have a chapter from the Architecture Document and need to
create a detailed outline before drafting.

**What it does:**

- Transforms chapter specs into beat-level outlines
- Guides drafting while preserving creative freedom
- Tracks reader's intellectual and emotional journey through each beat
- Provides collaborative partnership with author for sequencing and debate

**Outputs:**

- Chapter Outline Document (context, reader journey, beat sequence,
  opening/closing deep dives)

---

## Workflow

1. **Start with ideation** — Run `book-ideation` to develop your raw idea into a
   structured concept
2. **Validate the concept** — Run `book-idea-validator` to stress-test against
   research, then `book-market-research` to assess commercial viability
3. **Make the Go/No-Go decision** — Review both reports and decide whether to
   proceed
4. **Architect the book** — Run `book-architect` to design the complete
   structure before drafting
5. **Conduct research** — Run `book-research-assistant` to plan research
   prompts, execute deep research externally, then validate findings
6. **Plan each chapter** — Run `chapter-architect` to create beat-level outlines
   for individual chapters before drafting

Each skill produces documents that the next skill consumes, creating a
consistent, repeatable workflow.
