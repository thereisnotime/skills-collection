## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share it with everything else Claude
needs: system prompt, conversation history, and user requests.

**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude
doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

- "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

| Freedom Level | When to Use                                  | Example                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **High**      | Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent | Text-based heuristics      |
| **Medium**    | Preferred pattern exists, some variation OK  | Pseudocode with parameters |
| **Low**       | Fragile operations, consistency critical     | Specific scripts           |

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge needs specific guardrails
(low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:

1. **Metadata** (name + description) — Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** — When skill triggers (<5k words ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** — As needed by Claude (unlimited)

This keeps context lean while making depth available on demand.

## Quick Start: Creating a Skill

### 1. Create the folder structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required
├── references/           # Optional
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── assets/               # Optional
    └── template.md
```

### 2. Write the SKILL.md frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description:
  A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it. Should be at
  least 20 characters.
---
```

### 3. Write the instructions

```markdown
# My Skill

[Core instructions for Claude]

## Workflow

[Step-by-step guidance]

## References

For detailed information on X, see `references/detailed-guide.md`.
```

### 4. Package for Claude.ai

```bash
python build.py my-skill
```

### 5. Upload

Go to Claude.ai → Settings → Skills → Upload `dist/my-skill.skill`

## What Makes a Good Skill?

| Quality         | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Focused**     | One job, done well                         |
| **Concise**     | Only essential information                 |
| **Structured**  | Clear workflow with defined inputs/outputs |
| **Progressive** | Core in SKILL.md, details in references    |
| **Tested**      | Validated with real usage                  |
