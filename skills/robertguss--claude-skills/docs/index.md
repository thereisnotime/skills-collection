A collection of custom skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized
workflows, methods, and domain knowledge.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are modular packages that transform Claude from a general-purpose
assistant into a specialized collaborator. Each skill contains:

- **Instructions** - Detailed guidance for specific domains and workflows
- **Reference documentation** - Deep knowledge loaded on-demand
- **Templates** - Structured output formats for consistent results

Skills work with both **Claude Code** (CLI) and **Claude.ai**
(web/mobile/desktop).
