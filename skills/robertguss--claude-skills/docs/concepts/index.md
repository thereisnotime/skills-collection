## Core Concepts

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-pipe:{ .lg .middle } **[Pipelines](pipelines.md)**

  ***

  How skills chain together in sequences, with structured handoffs between
  stages.

- :material-clock-outline:{ .lg .middle }
  **[Session Continuity](session-continuity.md)**

  ***

  How skills maintain context across sessions spanning days or weeks.

- :material-swap-horizontal:{ .lg .middle } **[Handoffs](handoffs.md)**

  ***

  The structured documents that pass between skills in a pipeline.

- :material-toggle-switch:{ .lg .middle }
  **[Modes & Registers](modes-and-registers.md)**

  ***

  Different operating modes skills offer for different situations.

- :material-link-variant:{ .lg .middle }
  **[Skill Connections](skill-connections.md)**

  ***

  How skills relate to each other and can be combined for complex workflows.

## Why These Concepts Matter

Skills aren't just instruction sets—they're designed systems with specific
patterns that make them powerful:

| Concept                | Problem It Solves                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pipelines**          | Complex work needs specialists, not generalists        |
| **Session Continuity** | Creative work happens over time, not in one sitting    |
| **Handoffs**           | Each specialist needs clear input from the previous    |
| **Modes**              | Different situations need different approaches         |
| **Skill Connections**  | Complex projects need multiple skills working together |

## How They Work Together

```mermaid

    subgraph Pipeline["Pipeline (e.g., Book Factory)"]
        A[Skill 1: Ideation] -->|Handoff Doc| B[Skill 2: Validation]
        B -->|Handoff Doc| C[Skill 3: Architecture]
    end

    subgraph Continuity["Session Continuity"]
        S1[Session 1] -->|v1 doc| S2[Session 2]
        S2 -->|v2 doc| S3[Session 3]
    end

    subgraph Modes["Modes"]
        M1[Deep Mode]
        M2[Quick Mode]
        M3[Connected Mode]
        M4[Clean-Slate Mode]
    end
```

A typical workflow combines all these concepts:

1. You start a **pipeline** at the first skill
2. Across multiple **sessions**, you develop the work (continuity via versioned
   documents)
3. You choose appropriate **modes** based on your situation
4. When ready, the skill produces a **handoff document** for the next skill
