# Handoffs

The structured documents that pass between skills in a pipeline.

## What Are Handoffs?

When one skill completes its work, it produces a **handoff document**—a
structured output that contains everything the next skill needs to continue.
Handoffs are the connective tissue of pipelines.

Think of it like a relay race: the baton (handoff document) carries all the
context so the next runner (skill) can continue without starting over.

## Anatomy of a Handoff

A typical handoff document contains:

| Section              | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**          | Quick orientation on what this represents    |
| **Core Elements**    | The substantive content the next skill needs |
| **Decisions Made**   | What was decided, with reasoning             |
| **Recommendations**  | Guidance for the downstream skill            |
| **Concerns/Flags**   | Issues the next skill should address         |
| **Readiness Status** | Whether this is complete or partial          |

## Example: Book Concept Document

The `book-ideation` skill produces a Book Concept Document as its handoff:

```markdown
# Book Concept Document: [Title]

## Summary

[2-3 sentences describing the book]

## The Eight Elements

### 1. The Reader

[Specific description of who this is for]

### 2. The Transformation

Before: [Where reader starts] After: [Where reader ends up]

### 3. The Core Thesis

[The one big idea someone can disagree with]

### 4. The Author Angle

[Why this author writes this book]

### 5. The Stakes

[Why it matters, why now]

### 6. The Key Concepts

[3-7 major ideas supporting the thesis]

### 7. The Enemy

[What this book argues against]

### 8. The Promise

[One sentence: what does the reader get?]

## Readiness

[Ready for validation / Needs more work on X]

## Notes for Downstream

[Any context the next skill should know]
```

This document then feeds into `book-idea-validator` and `book-market-research`.

## Handoff Patterns

### One-to-One

Simple handoff to the next skill:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[book-ideation] -->|Book Concept Doc| B[book-idea-validator]
```

### One-to-Many

Some handoffs feed multiple downstream skills:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[book-ideation] -->|Book Concept Doc| B[book-idea-validator]
    A -->|Book Concept Doc| C[book-market-research]
```

### Accumulating Handoffs

Downstream skills often receive multiple handoffs:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[book-ideation] -->|Concept Doc| D[book-architect]
    B[book-idea-validator] -->|Validation Report| D
    C[book-market-research] -->|Market Report| D
```

---

## Readiness Criteria

Each handoff has explicit readiness criteria—conditions that must be met before
the document is ready for downstream use.

### Example: Book Concept Document Readiness

The Book Concept Document is ready when:

- [ ] All eight elements are developed (not just listed)
- [ ] Reader can be described as a specific person
- [ ] Transformation has concrete before/after states
- [ ] Thesis is a claim someone can disagree with
- [ ] Promise is one compelling sentence

### Partial Handoffs

Sometimes work isn't complete but progress needs to continue:

```markdown
## Readiness: Partial

Ready for validation: Yes Concerns: The Author Angle is underdeveloped—validator
should flag if this causes credibility concerns.
```

The downstream skill knows what to watch for.

## Handoff vs. Version Document

| Aspect     | Handoff Document   | Version Document         |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Purpose    | Pass to next skill | Continue within skill    |
| Audience   | Downstream skill   | Same skill, next session |
| Content    | Final outputs      | Working state            |
| Versioning | Single document    | v1, v2, v3...            |

A session might produce multiple version documents but culminate in one handoff
document when the skill's work is complete.

## Common Handoff Documents

| Skill                   | Produces                              | Consumed By                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| book-ideation           | Book Concept Document                 | book-idea-validator, book-market-research  |
| book-idea-validator     | Validation Report                     | book-market-research, book-architect       |
| book-market-research    | Market Research Report                | book-architect                             |
| book-architect          | Architecture Documents, Research Gaps | book-research-assistant, chapter-architect |
| book-research-assistant | Research Synthesis                    | chapter-architect                          |
| writing-dna-discovery   | Voice DNA Document                    | ghost-writer                               |
| ebook-discovery         | Discovery Tracker, Handoff Summary    | ebook-concept-development                  |

## Creating Good Handoffs

### Do

- **Include reasoning, not just conclusions** — Downstream skills benefit from
  understanding why
- **Flag concerns explicitly** — Don't hide problems; surface them for the next
  skill
- **Meet readiness criteria** — Don't handoff incomplete work without marking it
  partial
- **Use consistent structure** — Templates enable reliable consumption

### Don't

- **Dump raw session content** — Handoffs are curated, not transcripts
- **Assume context** — The downstream skill may be a fresh Claude instance
- **Skip the summary** — Quick orientation helps the next skill engage faster

---

## When Handoffs Flow Backward

Sometimes downstream skills discover problems that require upstream revision:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[book-architect] -->|Architecture Feedback| B[book-ideation]
    A -->|Research Gaps| C[book-research-assistant]
    C -->|Thesis Tension| A
```

This feedback loop ensures quality: if research reveals the thesis is flawed,
that information flows back to architecture for structural revision.
