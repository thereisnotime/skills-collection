# Writing Skills

> A pipeline for capturing and replicating a writer's authentic voice.

## Overview

The Writing Skills pipeline solves a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted
writing: producing drafts that genuinely sound like you, not like generic AI
output. Rather than relying on vague style descriptions or hope, this pipeline
takes a systematic approach to voice capture and application.

The workflow has two phases. First, **Writing DNA Discovery** captures the
"genetic code" of your voice through collaborative analysis and interview. This
produces a structured Voice DNA Document containing patterns, anti-patterns,
exemplar passages, and actionable guidance. Second, **Ghost Writer** consumes
that document to generate first drafts at approximately 80% voice accuracy. You
add the remaining 20%: the creative spark, situational judgment, and final
polish.

This is not about replacing the writer. It is about giving you a strong starting
point that sounds like you, saving the mental energy of starting from scratch
while preserving your distinctive voice.

## Philosophy

### Voice Authenticity Over "Good Writing"

The goal is not to produce objectively "good" writing. The goal is to produce
writing that sounds like you. A distinctive voice may include patterns that
writing guides would discourage, but those patterns are part of what makes your
writing recognizably yours.

### 80% Accuracy Target

The skills aim for 80% voice accuracy in first drafts. This is intentional. The
remaining 20% is where your creative judgment, situational awareness, and final
polish come in. These skills accelerate your process; they do not replace your
input.

### Living Documents

Your Voice DNA Document is not static. Initial discovery captures the
foundation. Return sessions deepen, refine, and adapt as your voice evolves.
Each round of ghost writing feedback becomes material for DNA refinement.

### Anti-Patterns Are Critical

What you do not do is as important as what you do. The DNA document captures
words, structures, and tones that would make readers think "that is not their
writing." This includes AI patterns that must be actively suppressed.

### One Register Per Session

Each discovery session focuses on a single mode: blog posts, fiction prose,
technical writing, newsletters. Different contexts may call for different
voices. Create separate DNA documents if your voice varies significantly across
registers.

## Skills in This Pipeline

| Skill                                               | Purpose                                                      | Input                             | Output                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [Writing DNA Discovery](./writing-dna-discovery.md) | Capture voice patterns through interview and sample analysis | Writing samples + conversation    | Voice DNA Document                |
| [Ghost Writer](./ghost-writer.md)                   | Generate first drafts matching captured voice                | Voice DNA Document + writing task | Two meaningfully different drafts |

## Readiness Levels

Your Voice DNA Document has a readiness level that affects ghost writing
accuracy:

| Level              | Accuracy | What It Means                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimum Viable** | 60-70%   | 3-5 strong patterns, clear tone, key anti-patterns documented                    |
| **Solid**          | 75-85%   | Multiple dimensions developed, exemplar passages annotated, stress-tested        |
| **Strong**         | 85-90%   | Deep analysis across dimensions, validated against output, refined from feedback |

## Getting Started

### First-Time Users

1. **Gather writing samples**: Collect 3-5 pieces that represent your authentic
   voice. Choose writing you are proud of, not pieces that were heavily edited
   by others.

2. **Run Writing DNA Discovery**: Provide your samples and engage in the
   collaborative interview. Be honest about what is truly "you" versus
   aspirational patterns.

3. **Reach Minimum Viable readiness**: Continue the session until the skill
   confirms at least Minimum Viable status. This typically takes one focused
   session.

4. **Run Ghost Writer**: Provide your Voice DNA Document and a writing task.
   Review both drafts, noting what works and what feels off.

5. **Iterate and refine**: Use feedback to improve drafts within the session.
   After multiple sessions, return to DNA Discovery to refine your profile based
   on what the ghost writer consistently gets wrong.

### Returning Users

- **New writing task**: Run Ghost Writer with your existing DNA document
- **Voice has evolved**: Run a DNA Discovery evolution session
- **Ghost writer keeps missing something**: Run a DNA Discovery refinement
  session to convert feedback into explicit anti-patterns
- **New writing context**: Run a DNA Discovery session for the new register
  (creates a separate DNA document)

## Key Concepts

### Voice Dimensions

The DNA Discovery skill analyzes multiple dimensions of voice:

**Core Dimensions** (always explored):

- Sentence Rhythm: length variation, internal structure, emphasis placement
- Punctuation Personality: em-dashes, semicolons, parentheses, comma density
- Word Choice: vocabulary level, favorites, avoided words
- Tone and Temperature: warm/cool, formal/casual, confident/hedging
- Reader Relationship: first-person presence, direct address, authority stance

**Extended Dimensions** (as relevant):

- Opening Moves: how pieces begin
- Closing Moves: how pieces end
- Structural Patterns: paragraph construction, transitions
- Confidence/Hedging: qualifier density, uncertainty handling
- Humor Approach: type, placement, frequency
- Signature Elements: distinctive moves, pet phrases

### The Voice DNA Document

The output of DNA Discovery is a structured document containing:

- **Quick Reference**: Core temperature, sentence signature, distinctive moves,
  never-dos
- **Voice Profile**: Dimension-by-dimension analysis with examples
- **Exemplar Passages**: Annotated excerpts demonstrating patterns in action
- **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid, including AI patterns to suppress
- **Ghost Writer Briefing**: Do This, Don't Do This, When Uncertain rules
- **Profile Metadata**: Readiness level, confidence assessment, gaps

### Dual-Draft Approach

Ghost Writer always produces two meaningfully different drafts. Differences
might include:

- Structural approach (narrative vs. analytical)
- Opening strategy (direct hook vs. scene-setting)
- Tone variation (within documented range)
- Emphasis (different aspects highlighted)

This gives you options and reveals trade-offs rather than presenting a single
"correct" interpretation.

## Integration Notes

The Writing Skills pipeline is designed to be self-contained but can integrate
with other workflows:

- **Research phase**: Gather materials before running Ghost Writer. The skill
  will ask about research sufficiency and can work with provided context.
- **Editing phase**: Drafts from Ghost Writer are starting points. Apply your
  editing process as you normally would.
- **Series writing**: Provide Ghost Writer with prior pieces to maintain
  continuity across a series.

## Best Practices

1. **Be honest during discovery**: The DNA document captures your actual voice.
   If you want to evolve your voice, note that explicitly so the skill can
   capture both current patterns and aspirational direction.

2. **Provide diverse samples**: Include pieces from different moods, topics, and
   lengths to capture the full range of your voice.

3. **Engage in the interview**: The collaborative dialogue surfaces patterns you
   may not consciously recognize. Push back when something does not feel right.

4. **Read drafts aloud**: Voice patterns are often most apparent when you hear
   them. Read Ghost Writer output aloud to spot what feels "off."

5. **Give specific feedback**: "This doesn't sound like me" is less useful than
   "I would never start a paragraph with 'However'" or "These sentences are too
   long for my voice."

6. **Iterate on the DNA document**: The profile improves with use. Return to DNA
   Discovery when you notice patterns the ghost writer consistently misses.
