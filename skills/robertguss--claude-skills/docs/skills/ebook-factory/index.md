# Ebook Factory

> A streamlined pipeline for creating high-quality ebooks - concentrated
> solutions optimized for speed-to-value.

## Overview

The Ebook Factory is a suite of Claude skills designed specifically for ebook
creation. Unlike the Book Factory (designed for 50,000-80,000 word nonfiction
books), this pipeline is right-sized for 10,000-25,000 word ebooks that can be
completed faster with lighter process overhead.

The core philosophy: **Ebooks are not compressed books - they are a distinct
format optimized for speed-to-value.** The constraint of being shorter makes
ebooks harder to write well, not easier. Every sentence must earn its place. The
reader who buys a short read values their time and expects density without
filler.

## Pipeline Characteristics

| Characteristic                | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear but flexible**       | Skills flow in sequence, but some may be compressed or skipped   |
| **Single-session default**    | Each skill designed to complete in one focused session           |
| **Chapter-by-chapter option** | Outlining and drafting can work incrementally with review points |
| **Research is conditional**   | Not every ebook needs dedicated research                         |
| **Discovery is optional**     | Users with existing ideas skip straight to Concept Development   |

## Ebooks vs. Full Books

| Aspect               | Ebook                 | Full Book                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Word Count**       | 10,000-25,000         | 50,000-80,000              |
| **Timeline**         | Weeks                 | Months                     |
| **Transformation**   | Single, focused       | Multi-stage, comprehensive |
| **Reading Sessions** | 1-3 sessions          | Multiple sessions          |
| **Chapter Count**    | 4-8 chapters          | 12-20+ chapters            |
| **Process Weight**   | Lighter documentation | Thorough documentation     |
| **AI Role**          | Primary drafter       | Coach/collaborator         |

## When to Use This Pipeline

**Use Ebook Factory when:**

- Your transformation is tight and specific
- The content naturally fits 10,000-25,000 words
- You want to ship quickly
- You're repurposing existing content (videos, blog posts, newsletters)
- You're testing audience interest before a larger book
- The reader's problem can be solved in 1-3 reading sessions

**Use Book Factory when:**

- Your transformation requires multiple sequential stages
- The topic demands comprehensive treatment
- You need extensive research and evidence
- The content naturally expands to 50,000+ words
- You're building a definitive resource

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Document Per Skill

Each skill produces one working document rather than multiple files. Simpler to
track, easier to pass forward.

### 2. Embedded References

Essential guidance is embedded in skills rather than split across many reference
files. References are limited to catalogs and templates that would bloat the
main skill.

### 3. Single-Session Default

Skills are designed to complete in one focused session. This creates momentum
and prevents projects from stalling.

### 4. Reader-First, Always

Every decision - structural, stylistic, content - is evaluated from the reader's
perspective. Will this help the reader understand? Keep them engaged? Move them
toward transformation?

### 5. Claude as True Collaborator

Claude is not an assistant waiting for instructions. Claude contributes ideas
proactively, pushes back on weak thinking, challenges assumptions, and brings
genuine expertise.

### 6. Brutal Honesty Over Ego Protection

The skills exist to surface problems early when they're cheap to fix. Better to
kill a weak idea now than finish a weak ebook later.

### 7. Quality Through Constraint

Brevity is the discipline. The constraint of being shorter forces higher quality
per page.
