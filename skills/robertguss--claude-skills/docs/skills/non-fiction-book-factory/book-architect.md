# Book Architect

> Design the structural and emotional architecture for nonfiction books. Creates
> the comprehensive blueprint before drafting—every structural decision serves
> the reader's transformation journey.

---

## Overview

The Book Architect skill designs the reader's journey and creates a
comprehensive structural blueprint for nonfiction books. The guiding principle:
the question is never "how do I organize my ideas?" but "what does the reader
need to experience, in what order, to be transformed?"

This skill creates **dual architecture**—both structural architecture (what goes
where) and emotional architecture (what the reader feels and experiences).
Chapters aren't containers for content; they're journeys that transform readers
from an entry state to an exit state.

Claude operates as an expert collaborator: direct about architectural problems,
pushing back on weak structure, but warm toward the author—ruthless toward the
architecture, supportive of the person.

### Basic Usage

=== "Claude Code"

    ```markdown
    When architecting a book, read and follow /path/to/claude-skills/non-fiction-book-factory/book-architect/SKILL.md.
    ```

=== "Claude.ai"

    Upload `book-architect.skill` to Settings → Skills.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Reader-first architecture** — Every decision is justified by reader
   experience, not author convenience

2. **Chapters are journeys, not containers** — Each transforms the reader from
   entry state to exit state

3. **Diagnose before prescribing** — Assess what THIS book needs rather than
   applying a formula

4. **Expert with warmth** — Direct about problems, supportive of the person

---

## Workflow

### Intake Process

Claude reads all provided documents and produces:

1. **Synthesis Statement** — "Here's what I understand this book to be..."
2. **Readiness Verdict** — Green / Yellow / Red
3. **Structural Intuitions** — Initial hunches (not decisions—starting points)
4. **Concerns & Questions** — Issues to address
5. **The Burning Question** — Single most important thing to resolve
6. **Proposed Work Plan** — Sessions needed, sequence of work

### Readiness Signals

**Green (ready to proceed):**

- Thesis implies structure
- Transformation has verbs (reader will START doing X, STOP doing Y)
- Key concepts have relationships
- Enemy is specific enough to create drama

**Red (needs upstream work):**

- Multiple books hiding as one
- Unresolved validation concerns
- Market positioning contradicts concept
- Cannot articulate book in one clear paragraph

### Building Architecture

**Book-Level:**

- Refine thesis and promise statement
- Map transformation arc (stages reader moves through)
- Select structural framework
- Identify through-lines (themes woven throughout)
- Map objections and resistance points
- Assess proof burdens
- Design pacing strategy

**Chapter-Level:**

- Work section by section
- Define all blueprint elements for each chapter
- Ensure hook chain flows
- Watch for pacing problems
- Flag research gaps as they emerge

## Chapter Blueprint Elements

Each chapter blueprint includes:

- Chapter number, title, type, one-line description
- Chapter weight (Heavy/Medium/Light)
- Incoming hook, outgoing hook
- Reader emotional arc (starts/ends)
- Key insight (the ONE thing)
- Purpose (chapter's job)
- Content outline
- Through-line moments
- Structural connections
- What NOT to include
- Proof burden notes
- Resistance points
- Research gaps

---

## Readiness Criteria

Architecture is complete when:

1. Master Architecture Document is finalized
2. All Section Blueprints complete with every field filled
3. Hook chain flows end-to-end
4. Pacing shows intentional rhythm
5. Every chapter has a distinct key insight
6. All P1 research gaps documented with prompts
7. Stress test passes
8. Author confirms this is the book they want to write

---

## Best Practices

- **Provide all upstream documents** — Better input = better architecture
- **Trust the intake process** — Let Claude identify readiness issues
- **Accept pushback on structure** — That's where value lives
- **Don't rush chapters** — Each blueprint deserves full attention
- **Use the decision log** — Future you will appreciate the reasoning
