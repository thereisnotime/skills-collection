> Assess commercial viability of book concepts for Amazon KDP self-publishing.
> Produces a Market Research Report with viability scorecard and Go/No-Go
> recommendation. Works standalone or after idea-validator.

## Overview

The Book Market Research skill determines if a book is worth writing from a
business perspective, specifically for Amazon KDP self-publishing. It answers
the question: "Setting aside whether this is a good idea, can it succeed
commercially?"

A key insight: **commercial viability is separate from intellectual merit.** A
brilliant idea can fail commercially. A mediocre idea can succeed. This skill
assesses the market, not the idea itself.

Author intent shapes interpretation—the same viability score means different
things depending on whether you're writing for income, authority, passion, or
lead generation.

## Author Intent

Your intent determines how to interpret the viability score:

| Intent               | Description                | Score Interpretation                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Income**           | Book must generate revenue | Score is decisive—low = revise or kill    |
| **Authority**        | Book is a credential       | Moderate score OK if positioning strong   |
| **Passion/Legacy**   | "This book needs to exist" | Low score = proceed with eyes open        |
| **Lead Generation**  | Funnel for services        | Score less critical if book serves funnel |
| **Audience Service** | Serving existing followers | Platform strength matters more            |

## Score Interpretation

| Score   | Label              | Meaning                                       |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 7.0+    | **Strong Go**      | Market conditions favor success               |
| 5.5–6.9 | **Conditional Go** | Viable with strategic adjustments             |
| 4.0–5.4 | **Revise**         | Significant concerns—reposition or reconsider |
| <4.0    | **Kill**           | Market conditions unfavorable                 |

**Intent Overlay:**

- Income authors: Follow score literally
- Authority authors: Conditional Go sufficient if positioning strong
- Passion authors: Even Kill score = proceed with eyes open
- Lead Gen authors: Platform fit matters more than raw score

## Workflow

### Starting Research

1. Provide Book Concept Document (and Validation Report if available)
2. Claude asks about author intent
3. Claude recommends session mode with reasoning
4. You confirm mode
5. Proceed to research

### Quick Assessment Flow

1. Search for competing books
2. Analyze: competitor positioning, bestseller signals, review themes

4. Assess author credibility fit
5. Produce preliminary Market Research Report

### Deep Dive Flow

**Phase 1:** Quick Assessment steps + identify 5-8 key competitors

**Phase 2:** Claude generates pre-filled CSV; you gather Amazon data (~10 min)

**Phase 3:** Claude analyzes completed data for full scorecard

## Best Practices

- **Declare intent honestly** — It shapes interpretation
- **Do the data gathering** — 10 minutes on Amazon provides valuable
  quantitative insight

  viability
- **Use positioning guidance** — The how-to-differentiate matters as much as
  go/no-go

assessment

### Upstream Skills

- **book-ideation** — Provides Book Concept Document
- **book-idea-validator** — Provides Validation Report (optional)

### Downstream Skills

- **book-architect** — Receives Market Research Report + positioning guidance

## Scope Boundaries

This skill assesses **commercial viability**, not:

- Intellectual merit (that's [book-idea-validator](book-idea-validator.md))
- Book structure (that's [book-architect](book-architect.md))
- Writing quality (that's the editing pipeline)
