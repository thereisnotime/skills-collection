# Non-Fiction Book Factory

> A comprehensive pipeline that replicates traditional publishing infrastructure
> for nonfiction book creation using specialized Claude skills.

## Overview

The Non-Fiction Book Factory is a suite of six interconnected skills that guide
authors from initial idea to chapter-level outlines ready for drafting. Each
skill specializes in one phase of the book development process, producing
structured output that the next skill consumes.

Traditional publishing provides authors with developmental editors,
fact-checkers, market researchers, and structural consultants. Self-published
authors typically lack access to this infrastructure. This pipeline replicates
that expertise using Claude, creating a "book factory" with specialized skills
for each phase.

The factory is built on a core principle: **every decision serves the reader.**
The question is never "what do I want to say?" but "what transformation does the
reader need, and how can this book deliver it?"

## When to Use This Pipeline

**Use the Non-Fiction Book Factory when you:**

- Have a nonfiction book idea you want to develop systematically
- Want to validate ideas before investing months in writing
- Need structured architecture that serves the reader's journey
- Want to ensure your book stands out in the marketplace
- Are self-publishing through Amazon KDP
- Want a repeatable, professional process for book development

**This pipeline is NOT for:**

- Fiction (requires different approaches)
- Quick ebooks or lead magnets (see Ebook Factory)
- Academic papers or articles
- Blog post series

## Philosophy and Approach

### Reader-First Decision Making

Every decision in the pipeline--structural, stylistic, content--is evaluated
from the reader's perspective:

- Will this help the reader understand?
- Will this keep the reader engaged?
- Will this move the reader toward transformation?

### Validate Before Investing

The pipeline includes explicit validation gates to prevent wasted effort. Phase
2 (Validation) provides a Go/Revise/Kill decision point before committing to
architecture and drafting.

### Honest Feedback

Skills are designed to challenge weak thinking and surface problems early.
Claude functions as an intellectual partner, not a yes-man. Better to kill a
weak idea now than to finish a weak book later.

### Explicit Handoffs

Each skill produces structured output that the next skill consumes. Documents
are versioned (v1, v2, v3) so progress can be tracked and earlier versions
referenced.

## Workflow

1. **Start with ideation** - Run `book-ideation` to develop your raw idea into a
   structured concept with eight core elements

2. **Validate the concept** - Run `book-idea-validator` to stress-test against
   research, then `book-market-research` to assess commercial viability

3. **Make the Go/No-Go decision** - Review both reports and decide whether to
   proceed, revise, or kill the project

4. **Architect the book** - Run `book-architect` to design the complete
   structural and emotional architecture

5. **Conduct research** - Run `book-research-assistant` to plan research
   prompts, execute deep research externally, then validate findings

6. **Plan each chapter** - Run `chapter-architect` to create beat-level outlines
   for individual chapters before drafting

## Key Documents

The pipeline produces these core artifacts:

| Document                     | Created By              | Used By                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Book Concept Document        | book-ideation           | idea-validator, market-research, book-architect |
| Validation Report            | book-idea-validator     | market-research, book-architect                 |
| Market Research Report       | book-market-research    | book-architect                                  |
| Master Architecture Document | book-architect          | book-research-assistant, chapter-architect      |
| Section Blueprint Documents  | book-architect          | book-research-assistant, chapter-architect      |
| Research Gaps Document       | book-architect          | book-research-assistant                         |
| Chapter Research Summaries   | book-research-assistant | chapter-architect                               |
| Final Research Synthesis     | book-research-assistant | chapter-architect                               |
| Chapter Outline Documents    | chapter-architect       | draft-coach, ghostwriter                        |

## Getting Started

1. **Prepare your starting material** - This can be:
   - A raw idea (one sentence or paragraph)
   - Brainstorm documents
   - Zettelkasten notes or research collection
   - An existing partial concept

2. **Invoke book-ideation** - Share your material and work through the eight
   elements

3. **Follow the pipeline** - Each skill will guide you to the next step
