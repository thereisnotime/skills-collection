# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Publication Readiness

This checklist is the release gate for public publication surfaces. Do not use
it as evidence by itself. Fill the evidence fields with fresh command output or
URLs from the exact commit being released.

| Announcement copy | X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy point to live URLs | `rg -n "TODO" docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1` and repeat for `TBD` | `Blocker: final live release/npm/plugin URLs do not exist yet` | Release owner | Pending |
| Privileged workflow hardening | Release and maintenance workflows avoid persisted checkout tokens | `node scripts/ci/validate-workflow-security.js` | `Blocker:` | Release owner | Evidence recorded in post-hardening refresh |

## Do Not Publish If

- `main` has unreviewed release-surface changes after the evidence was recorded.
- `npm view ecc-universal dist-tags --json` contradicts the intended rc/GA tag.
- Claude plugin validation is unavailable or no clean-checkout install smoke
  test is recorded for the intended release commit.
- Release notes or announcement drafts still contain placeholder URLs,
  `TODO`, `TBD`, private workspace paths, or personal operator references.
- Billing, Marketplace, or plugin-submission copy claims a live surface before
  the live URL exists.
- Stale PR salvage work is mid-flight on the same branch.

## Announcement Order

1. Merge the release-version PR.
2. Record the required command evidence from the release commit.
3. Create or verify the GitHub prerelease.
4. Publish npm with the rc dist-tag.
5. Submit or update plugin marketplace surfaces.
6. Update release notes with final live URLs.
7. Publish GitHub release copy.
8. Publish X, LinkedIn, and longform copy only after the public URLs work.
