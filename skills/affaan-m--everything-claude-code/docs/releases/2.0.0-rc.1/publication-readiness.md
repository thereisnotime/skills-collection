it as evidence by itself. Fill the evidence fields with fresh command output or
URLs from the exact commit being released.

## Publication Gates

| Gate | Required evidence | Fresh check | Blocker field | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub release | Tag exists, release notes use final URLs, assets attached if needed | `gh release view v2.0.0-rc.1 --json tagName,url,isPrerelease` | `Blocker: release not found on 2026-05-12` | Release owner | Pending approval |
| npm package | `npm pack --dry-run` has expected files, version matches, rc goes to `next` | `npm pack --dry-run` and `npm publish --tag next --dry-run` where supported | `Blocker: actual publish requires approval; dry run passed with next tag` | Package owner | Dry-run passed |
| Claude plugin | Manifest validates, marketplace JSON points to public repo, install docs match slug | `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json`; `claude plugin tag .claude-plugin --dry-run`; isolated temp-home install smoke | `Blocker: real tag creation/push requires approval` | Plugin owner | Clean-checkout dry-run and install smoke recorded |
| Codex plugin | Manifest version matches package and docs, repo marketplace points at the plugin root, and OpenAI's current official Plugin Directory status is recorded | `node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js`; `node tests/plugin-manifest.test.js`; `codex plugin marketplace add --help`; temp-home `codex plugin marketplace add <local-checkout>` | `Blocker: official Plugin Directory publishing and self-serve management are documented as coming soon` | Plugin owner | Repo-marketplace distribution verified; official directory pending |

| Announcement copy | X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy point to live URLs | placeholder-marker scan and `release-url-ledger-2026-05-18.md` | `Blocker: final live release/npm/plugin/billing URLs do not exist yet; live and pending URLs are separated in the May 18 ledger` | Release owner | URL ledger recorded; final URLs pending |
| Privileged workflow hardening | Release and maintenance workflows avoid persisted checkout tokens | `node scripts/ci/validate-workflow-security.js` | `Blocker:` | Release owner | Evidence recorded in post-hardening refresh |

## Required Command Evidence

Record the exact commit SHA and command output before any publication action:

| Evidence | Command | Required result | Recorded output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean release branch | `git status --short --branch` | On intended release commit; no unrelated files | Pending final strict clean-checkout release pass; `publication-evidence-2026-05-17.md` records current `main` with unrelated untracked `docs/drafts/` |
| Preview-pack smoke | `npm run preview-pack:smoke` | Preview pack artifacts, Hermes boundary, final verification command list, and publication blockers pass | `publication-evidence-2026-05-17.md`: ready yes, digest `dfb1ed014607`, 5 passed, 0 failed; repeat in a final strict clean-checkout release pass |

| Release safety gate | `npm run observability:ready -- --format json` | Release Safety category passing with publication readiness, supply-chain, workflow security, package surface, and release-surface evidence | `publication-evidence-2026-05-13-post-hardening.md`: Release Safety 3/3 |
| Supply-chain verification | `npm audit --json`; `npm audit signatures`; `cd ecc2 && cargo audit -q`; Dependabot alerts; GitGuardian Security Checks | 0 vulnerabilities/alerts, registry signatures verified, GitGuardian clean | `publication-evidence-2026-05-18.md`: npm registry signatures and attestations verified, 0 high-or-higher npm vulnerabilities, repo/home IOC scans clean, current-head Supply-Chain Watch passed |
| Root suite | `node tests/run-all.js` | 0 failures | `publication-evidence-2026-05-17.md`: `npm test` passed 2487/2487, 0 failed |
| Markdown lint | `npx markdownlint-cli '**/*.md' --ignore node_modules` | 0 failures | `publication-evidence-2026-05-17.md`: passed after ja-JP autonomous-loop anchor repair |
| Package surface | `node tests/scripts/npm-publish-surface.test.js` | 0 failures; no Python bytecode in npm tarball | `2/2` passed in May 12 evidence pass |
| Release surface | `node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js` | 0 failures | `publication-evidence-2026-05-16.md`: 20/20 passed |
| Optional Rust surface | `cd ecc2 && cargo test` | 0 failures or explicit deferral | `publication-evidence-2026-05-16.md`: 462/462 passed, existing warnings only |
| Queue baseline | `gh pr list` / `gh issue list` across trunk, AgentShield, JARVIS, ECC Tools, and ECC website | Under 20 open PRs and under 20 open issues | `publication-evidence-2026-05-17.md`: platform audit ready, 0 open PRs and 0 open issues across checked repos |
| Discussion baseline | `node scripts/discussion-audit.js --json` | No unmanaged active discussion queue and no answerable Q&A missing an accepted answer | `publication-evidence-2026-05-15.md`: 58 trunk discussions, 0 without maintainer touch; other tracked repos disabled or 0 |
| Linear roadmap | Linear project and issue readback | Detailed roadmap exists with release, security, AgentShield, ECC Tools, legacy, and observability lanes | `publication-evidence-2026-05-15.md`: project and 16 issue lanes recorded |
| Operator readiness dashboard | `npm run operator:dashboard -- --json --allow-untracked docs/drafts/` | Current queue state mapped to macro-goal deliverables and incomplete gaps | `publication-evidence-2026-05-18.md`: generated from `3b7e0ba3`, platform ready true, dashboard ready true, 0 open PRs, 0 open issues, 0 discussion gaps; regenerated May 18 dashboard now also tracks the URL ledger |
| Release URL ledger | `docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/release-url-ledger-2026-05-18.md` plus placeholder-marker scan | Live links and approval-gated links are separated before announcement copy is posted | Ledger records public repo/docs/CI/supply-chain/npm/OpenAI Codex documentation URLs and blocks GitHub release/npm/plugin/billing/social URLs until approval-gated checks pass |

## Do Not Publish If

- `main` has unreviewed release-surface changes after the evidence was recorded.
- `npm view ecc-universal dist-tags --json` contradicts the intended rc/GA tag.
- Claude plugin validation is unavailable or no clean-checkout install smoke
  test is recorded for the intended release commit.
- Release notes or announcement drafts still contain placeholder URLs,
  `TODO`, `TBD`, private workspace paths, or personal operator references.
- Billing, Marketplace, or plugin-submission copy claims a live surface before
  the live URL exists.
- Stale PR salvage work is mid-flight on the same branch.

## Announcement Order

1. Merge the release-version PR.
2. Record the required command evidence from the release commit.
3. Create or verify the GitHub prerelease.
4. Publish npm with the rc dist-tag.
5. Submit or update plugin marketplace surfaces.
6. Regenerate the release URL ledger and update release notes with final live
   URLs.
7. Publish GitHub release copy.
8. Publish X, LinkedIn, and longform copy only after the public URLs work.
