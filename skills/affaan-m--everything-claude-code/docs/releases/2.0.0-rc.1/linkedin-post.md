# LinkedIn Draft - ECC v2.0.0-rc.1

ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 is ready for final release review as the first release-candidate pass at the 2.0 direction.

The practical shift is simple: ECC is no longer framed as only a Claude Code plugin or config bundle.

It is becoming a cross-harness operating system for agentic work:

- reusable skills instead of one-off prompts
- hooks and tests instead of manual discipline
- MCP-backed access to docs, code, browser automation, and research
- Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, Zed, and Claude Code surfaces that share the same core workflow layer
- Hermes as the operator shell for chat, cron, handoffs, and daily work routing

For this release-candidate surface, I kept the repo honest.

I did not publish private workspace state. I shipped the reusable layer:

- sanitized Hermes setup documentation
- release notes and launch collateral
- cross-harness architecture notes
- Hermes import guidance for turning local operator patterns into public ECC skills
- release-readiness gates for PRs, issues, discussions, Linear progress, legacy tails, observability, and supply-chain checks
- a deterministic preview-pack smoke test so the public pack can be verified before a release action

The leverage is not just better prompting.

It is reducing the number of isolated surfaces, turning repeated workflows into reusable skills, and making the operating system around the agent measurable.

The supply-chain work became part of the release story too. After the Mini
Shai-Hulud/TanStack campaign, rc.1 now includes IOC scanning, no-lifecycle CI
installs, advisory-source refresh, npm audit/signature checks, and AI-tool
persistence coverage.

There is still more to harden before GA, especially around packaging, installers, and the `ecc2/` control plane. But rc.1 is enough to show the shape clearly.

Public publication is still approval-gated until the GitHub release, npm
`next` publish, plugin path, final URLs, and billing/native-payments claims have
live evidence.

The release URL ledger now separates links that already resolve from links that
must wait for the approval-gated release, package, plugin, and billing checks.
