# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Publication Evidence - 2026-05-18

This is release-readiness evidence only. It does not create a GitHub release,
npm publication, plugin tag, marketplace submission, or announcement post.

## Source Commit

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream main | `04d4d81938b20ac2bac1f0025145ab77d6a59f5f` |
| Git remote | `https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git` |
| Evidence scope | Current `main` after PR #1970 workflow-security validator bypass fixes, PR #1971 metrics bridge cost-reporting fixes, PR #1972 `uncloud` skill merge, PR #1973 stale script cleanup, issue #1974 cost-reporting verification/closure, PR #1976 OpenAI/AstraFlow provider response guards, catalog/operator dashboard refresh, ECC-Tools Wrangler OAuth billing readback mirror, Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack protection recheck, defensive-deny IOC scanner hardening, current-head CI/security scan, work-items sync, and Linear progress sync |
| Local status caveat | `git status --short --branch` showed `## main...origin/main` plus unrelated untracked `docs/drafts/`; generated evidence files are committed after the source snapshot they describe |

The actual release operator should repeat all publish-facing checks from the
final release commit with a strictly clean checkout before publishing.

## Queue And Discussion State

| Surface | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trunk PRs | `gh pr list --limit 100 --json number,title,state,author,updatedAt,url` | 0 open PRs |
| Trunk issues | `gh issue list --limit 100 --json number,title,state,updatedAt,url,labels` | 0 open issues |

| Platform audit | `node scripts/platform-audit.js --json --allow-untracked docs/drafts/` | Ready; tracked repos report 0 open PRs, 0 open issues, 0 discussion maintainer-touch gaps, 0 answerable Q&A missing accepted answers, and 0 blocking dirty files |

| Operator dashboard | `node scripts/operator-readiness-dashboard.js --markdown --allow-untracked docs/drafts/ --write docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/operator-readiness-dashboard-2026-05-18.md` | Generated current dashboard for `04d4d81938b20ac2bac1f0025145ab77d6a59f5f`; dashboard ready true, publication ready false because release, npm, plugin, billing, and announcement gates are approval-gated |

## Merge And Triage Batch

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| PR #1970 | Merged workflow-security validator fixes for quoted `write-all` and `refs/pull/*` checkout bypasses; main includes `e06d0382` and `7bb31720` from that slice |
| PR #1971 | Merged metrics bridge cost-reporting fixes, full costs-file scan behavior, and persistent warning de-duplication across hook subprocesses; main includes commits through `9b1d8918` |
| PR #1972 | Merged `skills/uncloud/SKILL.md` with activation structure and uncloud command references; main includes `8b6aed0`, `2e5f30f`, and `caee7cf` |
| PR #1973 | Merged stale `skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.sh` removal after confirming the active hook is `scripts/hooks/suggest-compact.js`; remote main includes `812d4d06` |
| Issue #1974 | Closed after verifying current `origin/main` already reads the latest cumulative metrics bridge cost row and focused cost/metrics tests pass |
| Catalog/operator refresh | Pushed `81fca2ce` to refresh generated catalog count, URL ledger, and operator dashboard state after #1973/#1974 |
| PR #1976 | Merged provider response hardening for OpenAI-compatible and AstraFlow providers; main includes `eb0d8939` follow-up guards for empty/filtered provider choices, missing OpenAI `response.usage`, shared filtered-response error text, and credential-less provider construction validation |
| Provider guard validation | `uv run --extra dev pytest -q tests/test_provider_tools.py tests/test_astraflow_provider.py`, `uv run --extra dev pytest -q`, `node tests/run-all.js`, and `git diff --check` passed before merging #1976 follow-up into main: 11 provider-focused Python tests, 76 full Python tests, 2509 Node tests, and clean whitespace checks |
| Defensive-deny IOC scanner hardening | Pushed `04d4d819` so explicit Claude `permissions.deny` IOC entries are treated as defensive controls while the same IOC still fails in hooks, tasks, scripts, locks, and payload files; local `npm test` passed 2511/2511 and current-head CI `26017368895` passed 37/37 |
| Clean-worktree preview-pack smoke | Detached worktree at `742bc58d9748184dc6fd54ef42ffcf165c9d1360`; `node scripts/preview-pack-smoke.js --root <worktree> --format json` passed 5/5 with digest `59bbf2630a44`; required artifacts, final verification commands, Hermes public sanitization boundary, and approval-gated publication blockers were all preserved |
| Public queues | Rechecked after the merge and issue-closure batch; 0 PRs, 0 issues, and 0 discussion gaps remain across tracked repos |

## Supply-Chain And Security Evidence

| Gate | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo IOC scan | `npm run security:ioc-scan` | Passed; 198 files inspected |
| Home persistence IOC scan | `node scripts/ci/scan-supply-chain-iocs.js --home --json` | Passed; 200 files inspected; `findings: []` |

| AgentShield project scan | `npx --no-install ecc-agentshield scan --format json` | Grade A / 99; 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium; 6 low docs-example skill telemetry/governance findings |
| Current-head CI security scan | `gh run view 26017368895 --repo affaan-m/everything-claude-code --json status,conclusion,jobs,url` | Completed successfully for `04d4d81938b20ac2bac1f0025145ab77d6a59f5f`; 37/37 CI jobs passed, including lint, workflow/component validation, coverage, cross-platform package-manager tests, npm audit, and supply-chain IOC scan |
| Latest Supply-Chain Watch | `gh run view 26010432490 --repo affaan-m/everything-claude-code --json status,conclusion,headSha,url` | Completed successfully for `25ac57ac40e9fc5a0606e76e6339e72c79748c99`; rerun from the final release commit before publication |

## Linear Progress Sync

| Surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| ITO-57 issue comments | `0b9931b9-1556-4ebc-a70c-f3635557625d` records May 18 queue counts, #1970/#1971/#1972/#1976 merge evidence, supply-chain verification, current-head CI URL, deferred gates, and next slices; reply `6fa15367-d994-4e53-ade3-9462477e1100` records the expanded TanStack/Mini Shai-Hulud recheck, defensive-deny scanner fix, current-head CI `26017368895`, and post-push platform audit |
| ECC platform project comment | `e32e5b7a-287b-4bf4-9ed7-314389a157e1` records the same current public queue, security, #1976, and remaining-gate state at the project level |
| Project status update caveat | Linear returned "Project status updates are not enabled for this workspace"; project comment was used as the supported status surface |

## Current Publication Blockers

- GitHub prerelease `v2.0.0-rc.1` is still not created in this pass.
- npm `ecc-universal@2.0.0-rc.1` is still not published to the `next`
  dist-tag.
- Claude plugin tag and marketplace propagation remain approval-gated.
- Codex repo-marketplace distribution is verified for rc.1, but official
  Plugin Directory publishing remains blocked on OpenAI's self-serve publishing
  surface.
- ECC Tools billing/native-payments copy remains blocked until a Marketplace
  Pro purchase/webhook path writes ready production `billing-state:*`
  provenance, then `npm run billing:kv-readback -- --wrangler --require-ready`
  and `npm run billing:announcement-gate -- --account <github-login>` return
  announcement-ready gates. The latest Wrangler OAuth aggregate readback from
  ECC-Tools commit `42653f9` found 253 `account-billing:*` records, 253
  `billing-state:*` records, 0 Marketplace Pro states, 0 ready-like
  Marketplace Pro states, and 0 parse failures.
- Release notes, X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy still need final
  live URLs after release/package/plugin URLs exist.
- The local checkout still has unrelated untracked `docs/drafts/`, so a strict
  clean-checkout release pass remains required before real publication.

## Result

The tracked public PR queue, issue queue, discussion queue, local work-items
bridge, and Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack protection loop are current on
May 18, 2026 for `04d4d819`. This improves publication readiness but does not
replace the approval-gated release, package, plugin, billing, and announcement
steps in `publication-readiness.md`.
