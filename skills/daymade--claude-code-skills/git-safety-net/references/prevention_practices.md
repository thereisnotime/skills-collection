# Prevention Practices — keep a branch tangle from ever stranding work

ceremony; adopt the ones whose failure mode you're exposed to.

## Parallel / multi-branch work: commit before you switch (not stash, not worktree)

**Failure mode:** the classic disaster is `git stash` → switch branch → work → `git stash` again →
rebase → switch back. Each `stash` that gets superseded or dropped orphans a commit; after a busy
session you can have dozens of dangling stash states that `git stash list` no longer shows, one
`gc` from gone. The root cause is always the same — **uncommitted work**: a stash that can be
dropped, or edits a `switch` strands.

**Prevention:** never carry uncommitted work across a branch switch. Commit each line of work to
its own branch *before* moving, and push that branch early — a committed, pushed branch cannot be
stashed away or stranded:

```bash
# instead of `git stash` before switching:
git switch -c <branch-for-this-work>              # a branch for this line of work
git add <the paths for THIS work> && git commit -m "wip: ..."
git push -u origin <branch-for-this-work>         # early; re-push as you go
git switch <other-branch>                         # nothing left behind — no stash to drop
```

Then bring the work back to wherever you need it **live in the working tree** by merging — not by
fishing it out of a stash and not from a second checkout:

```bash
git switch <target-branch>
git merge <branch-for-this-work>                  # the work is now in THIS working tree too
```

**Deliberately avoided here — two tempting shortcuts that both cause the loss this skill exists to prevent:**

- **`git stash` + switch juggling** — orphans stashes (the failure mode above). Commit instead; a
  commit on a branch never silently disappears from `git stash list`.
- **`git worktree`** — a second checkout is one more place to leave work in and forget, it does
  **not** copy gitignored dependencies (`node_modules`, `.venv`), so tools/tests run there fail on
  the missing deps, and it can hand back a stale checkout of an older commit. A shared working tree
  with disciplined *commit-then-switch* is safer and simpler than juggling worktrees.

The safety comes from **committing early**, not from a second checkout. Once every line of work is
a pushed commit, `git log HEAD --branches --tags --not --remotes` (the at-risk check) only ever
lists what you haven't pushed yet — push it and it goes empty.

## Push work-in-progress branches early

**Failure mode:** a commit that exists only on a local branch is the *only* thing a dead disk
actually loses. Everything on a remote is safe.

**Prevention:** the moment a WIP branch has a commit worth keeping, push it:

```bash
git push -u origin <wip-branch>
```

It doesn't need to be a PR — just a remote copy. Re-push as you go. Then
`git log HEAD --branches --tags --not --remotes` (the at-risk check) stays empty, which is the
state you want.

## Confirm the branch before every commit

**Failure mode:** committing a fix onto the wrong feature branch (easy when juggling several, or
when an agent left you somewhere unexpected). The commit is then invisible to the PR it belongs
to, and gets deleted along with the wrong branch during cleanup.

**Prevention:** glance at the branch before committing:

```bash
git branch --show-current      # is this where this change belongs?
```

If you commit to the wrong branch anyway, it's recoverable: `git log` the sha, `git branch
correct-branch <sha>`, then remove it from the wrong branch — but confirming up front is free.

## Relocate your work when a parallel session switched the shared tree under you

**Failure mode:** two agents share one working tree. While you were editing, a *parallel* session
ran `git switch` and moved the shared tree onto **its** feature branch — so your uncommitted changes
now sit on top of that branch, mixed with the other session's own uncommitted edits. You never
switched, so "commit before you switch" never got a chance to fire. A naive `git add -A && git
commit` here buries your work inside the other branch's PR (wrong attribution, wrong review) and can
sweep in their file; committing onto their branch also couples your change to their merge.

**Fix — carry your uncommitted work onto a branch off the base, commit only your paths, then put the
tree back exactly where the other session left it:**

```bash
# 1. See what the hijacked branch is, and prove YOUR files are safe to carry across the switch.
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD                     # you're on their branch, not main
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD                 # their extra commits — confirm they're unrelated
git diff --quiet origin/main HEAD -- <your-file>    # exit 0 = your file is byte-identical on both
                                                    #   bases, so your edit carries with NO conflict

# 2. Create your branch off the base; the uncommitted edits ride along (no stash, no worktree).
git checkout origin/main -b fix/your-work

# 3. Commit ONLY your explicit paths — never `git add -A`; the other session's file is still here.
git add <your-path-1> <your-path-2>
git diff --cached --name-only                        # verify: only yours, not their file
git commit -m "…"                                    # then push / PR / merge as normal

# 4. Restore the other session's state: put the shared tree back on their branch.
git checkout <their-branch>                           # their uncommitted file carries back untouched
git branch -d fix/your-work                           # safe once merged (the branch tracked origin/main)
```

**Why this and not the alternatives:** `git stash` to move your edits risks the orphaned-stash loss
this skill exists to prevent; a `git worktree` won't have your gitignored deps. Step 1's `git diff
--quiet` is the load-bearing safety check — it proves your files are identical between the hijacked
branch's tip and the base, which is exactly the condition under which `checkout … -b` carries your
uncommitted edits with no conflict (if it reports a difference, stop and resolve it deliberately
rather than forcing the switch). Step 4 is correctness, not just courtesy: the parallel session
expects to find its own branch checked out with its work intact, exactly as it left it.

## Audit before rebase / branch-delete

**Failure mode:** deleting a branch or rebasing can orphan commits; if any were local-only, they
head toward gc.

**Prevention:** run the ten-second at-risk check first (see recovery_playbook.md):

```bash
git fetch --all --quiet
git log HEAD --branches --tags --not --remotes --oneline   # empty = nothing to lose; act freely
```

Non-empty → preserve those commits (branch/push/patch) before the destructive step.

## Snapshot before any history rewrite

**Failure mode:** `rebase`, `reset --hard`, `filter-repo`, and interactive-rebase mistakes abandon
the pre-rewrite commits.

**Prevention:** a throwaway backup branch makes the whole operation reversible:

```bash
git branch backup/pre-rewrite      # points at the current tip; delete once you're happy
```

If the rewrite goes wrong, `git reset --hard backup/pre-rewrite` restores it exactly.

## Version / lockfile collisions between parallel branches

**Failure mode:** two branches developed in parallel both bump the *same* shared file to the *same*
new value (a package version, a manifest version, a lockfile hash). They merge without a Git
conflict (both wrote the same line), but the second feature now ships under a version number the
first already used — so consumers that pin/refresh by version never see the second change.

**Prevention:** before bumping a shared version, check the base's current value, and bump *above*
whatever is already there:

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet
git show origin/main:<manifest>     # what version is main ALREADY at? bump to strictly higher
```

If a collision already merged, fix it by bumping again above the collided value and re-releasing.

## Commit-scope hygiene (don't sweep unrelated staged work)

**Failure mode:** `git add .` or `git commit -a` sweeps unrelated changes (another task's edits,
generated files) into a commit; later that commit gets reverted/reset and takes the unrelated work
with it.

**Prevention:** stage explicit paths, and verify the staged set before committing:

```bash
git add <the specific paths for THIS change>
git diff --cached --name-only        # confirm ONLY the intended files are staged
```

## Set a wider reflog safety window once

The reflog is your recovery window; widen it once, globally, so a busy repo doesn't age work out:

```bash
git config --global gc.reflogExpire "180 days"
git config --global gc.reflogExpireUnreachable "90 days"
```
