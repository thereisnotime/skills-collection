description: >-
  Only for explicit prior-work/reuse/history requests; never for read-only status or inspection.
  Finds and verifies existing successful work before substantial new production when reuse is
  materially plausible. Use when the user explicitly references earlier work, existing code/SOPs,
  history, prior decisions, another project, or says 以前做过, 已有代码, 别重复造轮子, reuse, or
  retrieve before produce. Also use when a genuinely new implementation would likely duplicate a
  known artifact. Do not invoke for read-only repo status, current-file inspection, simple
  explanation, mechanical verification, or merely because the final answer is a report/summary.
  Produces a source-verified reuse/adapt/reject receipt; zero hits never prove absence.

# Prior Work Retrieval

Run this before substantial production **only when the trigger above is present**. Read-only
current-state checks stay direct unless the user asks for history. Its job is not to generate another
summary. Its job is to answer: **what already exists, which source is current,
what should be reused, and what remains genuinely new?**

## Completion contract

A retrieval pass is complete only when all five are true:

1. The task's real business outcome is written as one sentence.
2. Every relevant carrier declared in the manifest reports `searched`,
   `manual_completed`, or an explicit failure/coverage gap.
3. Candidate claims are opened at their original path or record, not accepted
   from a search snippet alone.
4. Each adopted item has a `reuse` or `adapt` decision and a reason tied to the
   current task. If nothing is adopted, the receipt carries a concrete
   `no_reuse_reason`.
5. `scripts/prior_work.py check` accepts the receipt for this session.

`retrieved` is not `verified`; `verified` is not `reused`. Keep those states
separate so “I searched” cannot impersonate “I used our best prior work.”

## Workflow

### 1. Read the local operating context first

Before querying, read the current project's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, navigation
index, and any North Star/current-decision file they name. Historical material
cannot override a newer explicit decision.

### 2. Validate the explicit source manifest

The manifest is the only discovery scope. No directory exists merely because a
convention says it should. Default path:

```bash
uv run --no-project python scripts/prior_work.py \
  --manifest <path> validate-manifest
```

The default is `~/.config/daymade/prior-work/sources.json`; a project may pin
another path. Global options precede the subcommand. The schema and carrier
examples are in `references/source-manifest.md`.

### 3. Retrieve across declared carriers

Write the user-world outcome separately from the proposed implementation. Then
provide two term sets:

- `--outcome-term`: 1–5 artifact/event/entity/date terms that could locate an
  already-finished result (accepted deliverable, canonical transcript, deployed
  service, decision, or operating evidence).
- `--term`: 1–8 implementation terms (code symbols, old workflow names,
  technical nouns, failure symptoms).

The runtime sends the business-outcome query to documents, meetings, archives,
and conversations; it sends the implementation query to code and Skill
carriers. Outcome candidates are ranked first. A code search can therefore no
longer stand in for checking whether the requested result already exists. Do
not pass generic verbs such as “做 / 优化 / 系统” alone.

```bash
uv run --no-project python scripts/prior_work.py retrieve \
  --business-outcome 'the observable result the user actually needs' \
  --outcome-term 'accepted artifact, entity, event, or date' \
  --query 'the implementation or workflow currently being considered' \
  --term 'distinctive entity' \
  --term 'old workflow name' \
  --term 'failure symptom' \
  --session-id "$CODEX_SESSION_ID"
```

When a normally optional live carrier is material to the request, promote it
explicitly: `--require-source live-wechat`. The receipt cannot complete until
that manual route is recorded.

The command searches filesystem carriers with `rg`, calls explicitly declared
command adapters (for example the formal Claude-history finder), and surfaces
manual routes such as live WeChat. Content search is always bounded by declared
globs; full path enumeration runs only when an outcome/implementation term is
explicitly path-shaped (a filename, path, or ISO date). A symbol such as
`project_doc_max_bytes` does not justify walking every filename in a workspace.
The command writes an immutable run JSON under the manifest's `state_dir` and
returns its `run_id`.

If a required carrier says `manual_required`, perform that named Skill route and
record its result before completion. A local WeChat archive search does not
prove live WeChat coverage; a conversation index does not prove meeting or code
coverage.

### 4. Verify candidates at authority

Open promising candidates at their original path. Check:

- **Match**: does it solve the same business problem, not merely share words?
- **Authority**: current implementation/SSOT beats a historical proposal;
  raw transcript proves what was said, not that it remains correct.
- **Freshness**: compare current Git HEAD, file mtime, decision date, and any
  superseded marker. Do not use an archive to overwrite current behavior.
- **Outcome evidence**: prefer code/tests/accepted deliverables and operating
  results over a process that merely looks complete.

### 5. Complete the reuse receipt

Classify the items you actually inspected:

```bash
uv run --no-project python scripts/prior_work.py complete \
  --run <run_id> \
  --reuse '<candidate_id>=reuse unchanged because ...' \
  --adapt '<candidate_id>=adapt boundary X because ...' \
  --session-id "$CODEX_SESSION_ID"
```

If none qualify, use `--no-reuse-reason` with the verified mismatch. “No hits”
is not a reason; it is a retrieval observation and may require widening terms or
resolving a failed carrier.

The completed receipt preserves `business_outcome` and `outcome_terms`; `check`
rejects legacy or hand-built receipts that omit either field. Receipt freshness
is bound to the definitions of **required** carriers. Editing an optional carrier
does not invalidate already verified required coverage; changing a required root,
route, mode, authority, or limit does. The full manifest hash remains provenance.
Then verify:

```bash
uv run --no-project python scripts/prior_work.py check \
  --session-id "$CODEX_SESSION_ID"
```

Only after this passes should substantial production begin. Cite adopted
candidate IDs in the implementation/plan so the receipt is connected to the
result instead of becoming ceremonial paperwork.

## Companion hooks

Install after the manifest is valid and the self-test is green:

```bash
scripts/prior-work-retrieval.sh --selftest
scripts/prior-work-retrieval.sh --install
```

The installer adds three handlers to both Claude and Codex without replacing
unrelated hooks:

- `UserPromptSubmit` marks a new prompt-scoped requirement and injects the Skill
  route when prior-work or production signals are present.
- `PreToolUse` blocks substantial new/large writes, patches, delegated
  production, and Bash/Codex exec paths that carry a write signal or an unknown
  executable until the current requirement has a receipt. Read-only discovery,
  small mechanical edits, and `tinkle_` scratch files remain available.
- `Stop` validates a requirement that was already created by the current prompt
  or a substantial tool attempt. It never invents a new requirement merely
  because the final answer is long, list-shaped, or contains code.

It migrates the narrower unversioned `recall-first-evidence` UserPromptSubmit
handler into this superset while leaving its script on disk for recovery. The
old trigger families (“我们之前”, “什么来着”, fuzzy memory) are regression tests.
Run the machine's profile-settings synchronizer after installation so every
Claude profile receives the main settings. Codex requires one human trust review
through `/hooks`; the installer never forges it.

The user can explicitly say not to search prior work for the current prompt.
That opt-out becomes prompt-scoped state, not an environment-variable bypass.
Malformed/missing manifest or receipt state fails closed only at substantial
production; read-only investigation and a write targeting exactly the manifest
path remain possible so the agent can repair the gate without bypassing it.

## Search routing

| Need | Route |
|---|---|
| Known exact string, symbol, path | Filesystem carrier (`rg`) |
| Meaning remembered, wording changed | Declared semantic adapter (gbrain or Claude-history hybrid recall) |
| Exact prior Claude tool/thinking/file-history evidence | `read-claude-code-history search` |
| Meeting decision or speaker claim | Project transcript carrier; open raw speaker turn |
| Archived WeChat text/voice transcription | Declared WeChat archive carrier |
| Live/latest WeChat | `read-wechat-messages`; record manual coverage |
| Current code behavior | Open implementation/tests at current Git revision |

## Boundaries

- The manifest is explicit and versioned separately from mutable index state.
- Search results are hypotheses. The receipt records verification and reuse.
- Do not copy private project data into a public example or Skill fixture.
- Do not silently fall back from a failed required carrier. Record the gap.
- External web research starts after local prior work, unless the user explicitly
  asks for current external facts or the local evidence cannot answer.
- This Skill is the workflow. Companion hooks may require a fresh receipt before
  `Write`/`Edit`; Stop may enforce that same existing obligation, but final-answer
  shape cannot create a new one. Hooks do not decide which candidate is good.

## Maintainer verification

```bash
uv run --no-project python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
uv run --no-project python scripts/prior_work.py \
  --manifest tests/fixtures/manifest.json validate-manifest
scripts/prior-work-retrieval.sh --selftest
```

Regression cases must include the real failure families: cross-project rules not
loaded, existing provider contract ignored, old decision beating North Star,
artifact capability declared nonexistent, adjacent agent evidence missed, and
conversation/meeting/WeChat carrier gaps hidden by a global “searched” claim.
