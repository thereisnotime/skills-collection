  How to write, test, register, and debug Claude Code hooks — PreToolUse /
  PostToolUse / SessionStart / Stop Bash guards that enforce a rule the model
  would otherwise talk itself past. Use whenever the user wants to create a
  hook, block/intercept a tool call, turn a repeatedly-violated rule into a
  hard gate, add a guard rail, debug a hook that misfires or "poisons the
  session", register a hook across profiles, or mentions hooks /
  PreToolUse / Stop hook / 拦截 / 守卫 / 钩子 / 拦下. Bakes in the hard-won
  pitfalls: UserPromptSubmit only ever sees user input, never Claude's own
  text — a rule about Claude's own output belongs on Stop instead;
  token-level shlex matching (never awk splitting); bash -n + real-JSON
  end-to-end testing BEFORE registering (a corrupted PreToolUse hook poisons
  every Bash call); SSOT + symlink so a ~/.claude reinstall can't lose it;
  multi-profile convergence; and human-confirmation release gates. Reach for
  this even for "make it stop doing X" — a durable stop is a hook, not a
  reminder.

# Claude Code Hooks

Claude Code fires **hooks** at tool-call boundaries. A hook is a shell command
that receives a JSON event on stdin and, for blocking hooks, decides via its
**exit code** whether the tool call proceeds. This is the only mechanism that
*structurally* stops a behavior — a prose rule in CLAUDE.md is a suggestion the
completion drive can override; a hook is a wall.

## When a hook is the right tool (and when it isn't)

Write a hook when **a rule keeps getting violated even though it's already
written down**. The tell: you added the prose rule, it read clearly, and the
behavior recurred anyway — because at the moment of action, attention is 100%
on "get the thing done" and the reminder loses. That recurrence is the signal
to move the rule from prose (advisory) to a hook (enforced). Governance rule of
thumb: *Tier-0 irreversible action + only prose, no hook → it should be a hook.*
(**Tier-0** here = an action whose damage cannot be undone from inside the session:
destroying uncommitted work, pushing secrets to a remote, deleting files, publishing
something outward. The test is reversibility, not severity.)

Do **not** reach for a hook when: the rule has never actually recurred (don't
pre-build guards for hypothetical mistakes — cost with no proven benefit), or
the "rule" is a judgment call with no mechanical signature (a hook can only
match tokens/patterns; it can't judge whether a design is good).

## Hook types and what the exit code means

| Type | Fires | Exit 0 | Exit 2 | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PreToolUse** | before a tool runs | allow | **block** the call (stderr → shown to model as guidance) | any other exit = "non-blocking error" → **the call proceeds** |
| **PostToolUse** | after a tool ran | quiet **unless it prints a `hookSpecificOutput` JSON on stdout — that is how context injection works, and it happens at exit 0** | feedback to the model (can't un-run the tool) | — |
| **SessionStart** | session begins | proceed | — | **always exit 0** — never block a session |
| **Stop** (+ `SubagentStop`) | the model is about to finish responding | let it stop | **block the stop** — forces the model to keep going (stderr → fed back as the reason) | must check `stop_hook_active` or it can loop |

- **PreToolUse** is the workhorse — the only one that can *stop* an action.
  `matcher` selects the tool (`Bash`, `Agent`, `WebFetch`, …). Exit 2 blocks and
  the hook's **stderr** becomes the message the model sees — so put the *why* and
  the *correct alternative* there, not just "blocked".
- **PostToolUse** can't undo, but it can **inject authoritative context** so a
  later hallucination can't stand (e.g. re-read the real git HEAD after a commit
  and surface it — the model can't "believe it committed" against injected truth).
- **SessionStart** is for **health checks of the guard rails themselves** —
  silent when healthy, warn on breakage, always exit 0.
- **`set -euo pipefail` vs `set -uo pipefail` — pick by contract, not by habit.**
  A hook that may block (PreToolUse) wants `-e`: an unexpected failure aborting the
  script is survivable, because the caller treats a non-0/2 exit as "proceed". A hook
  whose contract is **ALWAYS exit 0** (PostToolUse injectors, SessionStart checks)
  must drop `-e` — with it, one `grep` that legitimately finds nothing kills the hook
  mid-way and the CLI surfaces a bare `Failed with non-blocking status code`. Rule of
  thumb: **`-e` for hooks that decide, no `-e` for hooks that report** (pitfall #8).
- **Stop is the odd one out, and the one most often reached for by mistake**:
  it's the *only* hook type that can react to what the model **itself just
  generated** (its own reply text). Every other hook type — including
  `UserPromptSubmit`, which sounds like a plausible place to police "what gets
  said" — only ever sees the **user's** input; it structurally cannot see the
  model's own output. A rule like "the model must not invent a shorthand name
  for something it hasn't verified" belongs on Stop; put it on
  `UserPromptSubmit` instead and it will (a) never once catch what it was
  built for, since that text never flows through that event, and (b)
  false-block the user's own unrelated typing whenever it happens to contain
  the trigger pattern. This is a category mistake, not a tuning problem — no
  amount of regex refinement on the wrong event fixes it. Full contract
  (`last_assistant_message` vs `transcript_path`, the anti-loop check) in
  Pattern E below.

Full runnable skeletons: [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

## The skeleton (PreToolUse Bash guard)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
INPUT=$(cat)                                   # the JSON event on stdin
TOOL=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_name',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ "$TOOL" != "Bash" ] && exit 0                # only guard the tool you mean to
CMD=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_input',{}).get('command',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ -z "$CMD" ] && exit 0
printf '%s' "$CMD" | grep -qw 'TRIGGER' || exit 0   # fast path: not relevant → allow
# ... precise detection here ...
if <command actually does the banned thing>; then
  echo "BLOCKED: ... WHY ... USE INSTEAD: ..." >&2   # stderr = the guidance shown
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

## Five rules that separate a working guard from a session-poisoning one

Not style preferences — each is a specific failure we shipped and traced back.

### 1. Match at the **token level with shlex**, never awk-split the raw string

A guard that **false-blocks a healthy command is worse than one that misses** —
a guard people must bypass gets bypassed reflexively, and then it protects
nothing (the core discipline: *误杀健康输入比漏报更糟*). The recurring cause of
false-blocks is matching on the raw command string.

- **Wrong**: `awk '{gsub(/&&|\|\||;|\|/,"\n")}'` to split into segments — awk
  doesn't understand shell quoting, so `grep -E "a|TRIGGER|b"` gets split at the
  `|` *inside the quoted regex*, `TRIGGER` becomes a phantom command, and the
  guard blocks a plain grep. (Shipped 2026-07-21; the guard's very first real use
  was a false-block on my own grep.)
- **Right**: tokenize the whole command with the **`shlex.shlex` class**, not the
  `shlex.split()` function — `split()` only treats `| ; & < >` as separators when
  they are space-separated, so `ls|TRIGGER x` tokenizes to `['ls|TRIGGER', 'x']` and
  your command-position check never sees `TRIGGER` at all (measured; the class with
  `punctuation_chars=True` yields `['ls', '|', 'TRIGGER', 'x']`). Use the walker in
  [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md#the-shlex-command-position-walker)
  verbatim rather than reaching for the one-liner. A quoted
  `"a|TRIGGER|b"` stays **one token**, so a regex argument is never mistaken for
  a command. Then check whether your target is in a **command position**
  (token[0], or right after a `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|` separator, skipping `VAR=val`
  env-assignment prefixes). Command-position walker in
  [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).
- Corollary: `echo "…TRIGGER…"`, `grep TRIGGER`, `# TRIGGER`, `man TRIGGER` must
  all pass. Your test set MUST include these mention-not-execute cases.
- **But shlex isn't a silver bullet, and *what* you detect changes whether
  fail-open is safe.** `shlex.split()` itself throws `ValueError` on an unbalanced
  quote — a multi-line `git commit -m "…` message with a `#` or an unclosed quote
  is the classic trigger. The `except ValueError: cmd.split()` fallback then
  *allows*, which is right when you're detecting a **banned modifier** (does this
  carry `--no-verify`? — missing it errs safe, Rule 1's direction), but
  **dangerous when you're detecting whether the command IS your target at all**
  (is this a `git commit`? — a ValueError there means the guard never recognises
  the commit and silently doesn't fire; a real cross-domain commit shipped with no
  confirmation dialog this way). For the *is-this-the-command* decision, prefer a
  narrow **regex** (`git` and `commit` as separate words, any flag tokens between)
  that's immune to multi-line-quote breakage; reserve the shlex walker for the
  *command-position / modifier* checks where fail-open is the safe direction.

### 2. Test with **bash -n + a real JSON event, end-to-end, BEFORE registering**

**A corrupted or wrong-logic PreToolUse hook poisons the *entire* session** —
every later Bash call gets truncated / duplicated / falsely-failed / looks
hallucinated-executed, and you'll blame "the environment" when it's the hook you
just installed. (2026-07-05: a `[^;&|]` regex broke in one edit, `;&` became a
bash case-fallthrough token, poisoned half a session until `bash -n` found it.)
"My tests passed at deploy" isn't enough — the file can corrupt in a *later* edit.

Gate before registering ANY hook:
```bash
bash -n hook.sh                                # syntax
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<trigger case>"}}'    | ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 2
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<healthy lookalike>"}}'| ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 0
```
Bundle the harness: [scripts/test_hook.sh](scripts/test_hook.sh) runs a whole
table of trigger/allow cases. **Self-block gotcha:** once the hook is live in the
session you cannot test it by putting the trigger string in your *own* Bash
command — the live hook blocks your test command. Put the cases in a **script
file** and run `bash test_hook.sh`; the outer command doesn't contain the
trigger, so it isn't self-blocked.

**Once a hook has caused one real incident (a false-block or a silent miss),
solo re-reading the code is not enough** — a same-day rewrite of a Stop-hook
guard was itself re-broken twice by the author while fixing the first bug (a
quote inside a Python comment, invisible on re-read, only surfaced by running
the actual failing JSON case). The escalation is a multi-lens agent-team
review where every finding must be reproduced by *executing* a real payload
against the live script, not by reading the code and agreeing — this is the
general Counter Review methodology
([skill-development-methodology.md](../../daymade-skill/skill-creator/references/skill-development-methodology.md)
Phase 6), applied to a hook instead of a skill. In one such pass, 3 lenses (matching
logic / shell-embedding safety / event-contract robustness) surfaced 13
confirmed, independently-reproduced bugs and 1 finding whose own cited
evidence turned out to be a hallucinated doc quote — caught only because the
verifier was required to curl the raw source and grep for the exact string
rather than trust the citation.

### 3. SSOT + symlink so a reinstall can't silently disarm the guard

Real script in a version-controlled dir, **symlinked** into the hooks dir Claude reads:
```
~/scripts/claude-hooks/<name>.sh      # SSOT (git: private repo)
~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh             # symlink → SSOT
```
A `~/.claude` reinstall wipes the hooks dir; the symlink target survives, and
recovery is one `ln -s`. A dangling symlink disables a Tier-0 guard with **zero
signal** — which is why a SessionStart health check exists (rule 4).

### 4. Registration is per-profile — converge ALL profiles, release via a HUMAN gate

- A hook in `~/.claude/hooks/` protects **nothing** if the *active profile's*
  `settings.json` doesn't call it. Multi-profile users ran with zero guards until
  every profile was converged. Register in the **main** profile's `settings.json`
  (PreToolUse → matcher `Bash` → your hook), then converge the rest (this setup
  uses `sync-profile-settings.py --all`, owned by the `claude-switch-models-setup`
  skill). A SessionStart health check greps each profile for the Tier-0 guards to
  catch drift.
- **If the guard needs a release valve, make it a *human* gate, not an env var.**
  A static `GUARD_OK=1` escape hatch is no gate — the model can set the env var
  itself. Replace with: a native macOS dialog (`osascript` — model can't click)
  and/or a typed `YES` on `/dev/tty` (model can't type into the user's terminal);
  refuse/cancel/timeout = hard NO; log every prompt/bypass to an audit file.
  Pattern in [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

### 5. Decide the failure **direction**, and test *that* — not just the happy path

Rule 1 ranked *detection-tuning* errors: given that the guard ran, false-blocking a
healthy command beats missing a rare bad one, because a guard people must bypass
gets bypassed reflexively. **This rule is about a different axis — the guard's
machinery not running at all** — so "which is worse" is not being reversed here;
the two rankings never meet. A tuning miss costs you one case; this costs you the
guard, silently, on every input of that shape.

The failure: the guard **cannot obtain the thing it judges on** — a parse throws, a path doesn't
resolve, a dependency is missing, a subprocess times out — and the very
`2>/dev/null || true` that stops the hook from crashing quietly converts *"I could
not check"* into *"nothing to report."* The hook exits 0. **That output is identical
to a real pass**, which is why this survives for weeks.

So at every point where the hook *obtains* something (parses the command, reads
staged files, queries a service), decide explicitly: **if this comes back empty, does
that mean allow or block?** — and write the answer next to the branch. Fail-open is
often right for a *modifier* check (does this carry `--no-verify`? missing it costs
you one case). Fail-closed is usually right for the *is-this-even-the-thing* check
(is this a cross-domain commit? an empty answer means the guard never fired at all).

**Then test the direction, not the happy path**: hand it an unresolvable path or an
unparseable command on purpose and assert it still does what you decided. A suite
where every row passes *because the hook silently allowed everything* is
indistinguishable from a suite that passes.

**Read those results carefully — the same input has opposite correct answers for
different guard classes.** Take `cd ~/no-such-dir && TRIGGER`:

| Guard class | Judges on | Correct exit | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Token matcher** (is this a banned command form?) | the command text alone | **2, block** | `TRIGGER` is right there in the text; an unresolvable `cd` doesn't make it not-a-trigger, and if the guard goes quiet here it will also go quiet on `cd ~/real-dir && TRIGGER` |
| **State deriver** (does the repo's staged set span domains?) | state read from disk | **0, allow** | `cd` fails, `&&` short-circuits, no commit ever happens — there is nothing to guard |

So decide which class your hook is *before* writing the row, and the harness's
`unresolvable path` template row expects **2** because that template targets the
token-matcher class. Getting this backwards produces a confident FAIL against a
correct guard. For a state-deriving guard the failure you are hunting is: **the command would really
have run and the guard didn't see it** — an unbalanced quote makes tokenizing throw,
the fallback allows, and a genuine cross-domain commit ships with no dialog (rule 1's
ValueError note). Ask of every allowed row: *would this command actually have done
the thing?* If no, the allow is correct.

Running this exact probe against a real state-deriving guard returned two allows on
the first pass: one was correct (the short-circuit above) and one was a genuine
fail-open. **The probe finds things; you still have to classify what it found** —
which is why the class table above comes before the rows.

Real case (2026-07-22): a scope guard read staged files via `git -C "$REPO_DIR"`
with `REPO_DIR` parsed out of the **command text** — so `cd ~/repo && git commit`
handed it a literal `~/repo`, `git -C` failed, staged came back empty, and the guard
concluded "no cross-domain files, allow." Every cross-repo commit went unguarded and
nothing ever looked wrong. Anatomy + the shared-library twist: pitfall #10.

## Build order (in sequence)

1. **Confirm it's a real recurrence**, not hypothetical — else don't build it.
2. Write the script in the SSOT dir; `chmod +x`.
3. **Detection** with shlex token-level matching (rule 1).
4. **`bash -n` + `test_hook.sh`** with trigger AND healthy-lookalike cases (rule 2) — do not register until green. Include the shapes that carry an unexpanded path (`cd ~/elsewhere && …`, rule 5) and, if the hook has a human gate, a forced-decline row (Pattern B, "Make the gate testable").
5. **Symlink** into `~/.claude/hooks/` (rule 3).
6. **Register** in main `settings.json` + converge profiles (rule 4).
7. For a Tier-0/irreversible action, add the **human-confirmation release gate** (rule 4).
8. **Persist**: commit the SSOT to its private repo. Optionally add a CLAUDE.md line (prose says *why* + the alternative; the hook enforces).

## Known pitfalls (read before debugging a misfiring hook)

Full catalog with symptom → cause → fix: [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md).
Headliners: `stdin` consumed by a `python3 - <<PY` heredoc (hook silently allows
everything), awk-split false-blocks (rule 1), corrupted hook poisoning the session
(rule 2), a quote or backtick inside a Python *comment* silently corrupting a
`python3 -c "…"` block with no syntax error (pitfall #9 — use the quoted-heredoc
form from Pattern E instead), static env escape hatch (rule 4), multi-profile
under-registration, and a path parsed from command text keeping its literal `~` so
the guard fails **open** with no symptom at all (#10 — the one you cannot wait to
notice, because silence is its only sign).

**The harness is the hidden variable — use `scripts/test_hook.sh`, don't hand-roll
one.** Every hand-rolled failure mode below produces the *same* output as a clean
pass, so it reads as success (2026-07-22, three in one sitting while fixing a Stop
hook's whitelist):

1. **Wrong event shape.** A Stop hook reads `last_assistant_message` /
   `transcript_path`, not `tool_name`/`tool_input`. Feed a PreToolUse-shaped event
   and it finds no text → exits 0 → "no false blocks!"
2. **JSON quoting.** `'{\"a\":1}'` inside single quotes emits a literal
   backslash-quote; `json.loads` throws, the hook's `2>/dev/null || exit 0` swallows
   it, every case "passes".
3. **A test case the rule legitimately exempts.** The baseline string used
   a string the rule *deliberately exempts* (the guard flagged coined nicknames of the
   form `<name> Group`, but exempted the ordinary phrases `in the group` / `group chat`
   — and the baseline row happened to use one of those). The one row meant to prove
   the guard still bites didn't bite, and the whole suite read green.

The common shape: **all-cases-agree is a smell, not a green light.** `test_hook.sh`
catches #1 and #2 structurally — it asserts an explicit `expected-exit` per row
(not "did it print something") and forces trigger rows alongside healthy-lookalike
ones, so a trigger row that returns 0 fails loudly instead of blending in. It
**cannot** catch #3: whether a row's content accidentally lands in an exemption is a
property of what you wrote, and no harness knows your rule's intent. That one is
caught only by the habit — assert a known-good trigger *first*, and when it doesn't
fire, suspect the row before the hook.
