  How to write, test, register, and debug Claude Code hooks — PreToolUse /
  PostToolUse / SessionStart Bash guards that enforce a rule the model would
  otherwise talk itself past. Use whenever the user wants to create a hook,
  block or intercept a tool call, turn a repeatedly-violated prose rule into a
  hard gate, add a guard rail, debug a hook that misfires or "poisons the
  session", register a hook across profiles, or mentions hooks / PreToolUse /
  拦截 / 守卫 / 钩子 / 拦下. Bakes in the hard-won pitfalls: token-level shlex
  matching (never awk splitting) so healthy commands aren't false-blocked,
  bash -n + real-JSON end-to-end testing BEFORE registering (a corrupted
  PreToolUse hook poisons every Bash call in the session), SSOT + symlink so a
  ~/.claude reinstall can't lose it, multi-profile registration convergence,
  and human-confirmation release gates. Reach for this even when the user just
  says "make it stop doing X" — a durable stop is a hook, not a reminder.

# Claude Code Hooks

Claude Code fires **hooks** at tool-call boundaries. A hook is a shell command
that receives a JSON event on stdin and, for blocking hooks, decides via its
**exit code** whether the tool call proceeds. This is the only mechanism that
*structurally* stops a behavior — a prose rule in CLAUDE.md is a suggestion the
completion drive can override; a hook is a wall.

## When a hook is the right tool (and when it isn't)

Write a hook when **a rule keeps getting violated even though it's already
written down**. The tell: you added the prose rule, it read clearly, and the
behavior recurred anyway — because at the moment of action, attention is 100%
on "get the thing done" and the reminder loses. That recurrence is the signal
to move the rule from prose (advisory) to a hook (enforced). Governance rule of
thumb: *Tier-0 irreversible action + only prose, no hook → it should be a hook.*

Do **not** reach for a hook when: the rule has never actually recurred (don't
pre-build guards for hypothetical mistakes — cost with no proven benefit), or
the "rule" is a judgment call with no mechanical signature (a hook can only
match tokens/patterns; it can't judge whether a design is good).

## Hook types and what the exit code means

| Type | Fires | Exit 0 | Exit 2 | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PreToolUse** | before a tool runs | allow | **block** the call (stderr → shown to model as guidance) | non-blocking error |
| **PostToolUse** | after a tool ran | quiet | inject feedback (can't un-run the tool) | — |
| **SessionStart** | session begins | proceed | — | **always exit 0** — never block a session |

- **PreToolUse** is the workhorse — the only one that can *stop* an action.
  `matcher` selects the tool (`Bash`, `Agent`, `WebFetch`, …). Exit 2 blocks and
  the hook's **stderr** becomes the message the model sees — so put the *why* and
  the *correct alternative* there, not just "blocked".
- **PostToolUse** can't undo, but it can **inject authoritative context** so a
  later hallucination can't stand (e.g. re-read the real git HEAD after a commit
  and surface it — the model can't "believe it committed" against injected truth).
- **SessionStart** is for **health checks of the guard rails themselves** —
  silent when healthy, warn on breakage, always exit 0.

Full runnable skeletons for all four: [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

## The skeleton (PreToolUse Bash guard)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
INPUT=$(cat)                                   # the JSON event on stdin
TOOL=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_name',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ "$TOOL" != "Bash" ] && exit 0                # only guard the tool you mean to
CMD=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_input',{}).get('command',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ -z "$CMD" ] && exit 0
printf '%s' "$CMD" | grep -qw 'TRIGGER' || exit 0   # fast path: not relevant → allow
# ... precise detection here ...
if <command actually does the banned thing>; then
  echo "BLOCKED: ... WHY ... USE INSTEAD: ..." >&2   # stderr = the guidance shown
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

## Four rules that separate a working guard from a session-poisoning one

Not style preferences — each is a specific failure we shipped and traced back.

### 1. Match at the **token level with shlex**, never awk-split the raw string

A guard that **false-blocks a healthy command is worse than one that misses** —
a guard people must bypass gets bypassed reflexively, and then it protects
nothing (the core discipline: *误杀健康输入比漏报更糟*). The recurring cause of
false-blocks is matching on the raw command string.

- **Wrong**: `awk '{gsub(/&&|\|\||;|\|/,"\n")}'` to split into segments — awk
  doesn't understand shell quoting, so `grep -E "a|TRIGGER|b"` gets split at the
  `|` *inside the quoted regex*, `TRIGGER` becomes a phantom command, and the
  guard blocks a plain grep. (Shipped 2026-07-21; the guard's very first real use
  was a false-block on my own grep.)
- **Right**: parse the whole command with `shlex.split()` in python. A quoted
  `"a|TRIGGER|b"` stays **one token**, so a regex argument is never mistaken for
  a command. Then check whether your target is in a **command position**
  (token[0], or right after a `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|` separator, skipping `VAR=val`
  env-assignment prefixes). Command-position walker in
  [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).
- Corollary: `echo "…TRIGGER…"`, `grep TRIGGER`, `# TRIGGER`, `man TRIGGER` must
  all pass. Your test set MUST include these mention-not-execute cases.
- **But shlex isn't a silver bullet, and *what* you detect changes whether
  fail-open is safe.** `shlex.split()` itself throws `ValueError` on an unbalanced
  quote — a multi-line `git commit -m "…` message with a `#` or an unclosed quote
  is the classic trigger. The `except ValueError: cmd.split()` fallback then
  *allows*, which is right when you're detecting a **banned modifier** (does this
  carry `--no-verify`? — missing it errs safe, Rule 1's direction), but
  **dangerous when you're detecting whether the command IS your target at all**
  (is this a `git commit`? — a ValueError there means the guard never recognises
  the commit and silently doesn't fire; a real cross-domain commit shipped with no
  confirmation dialog this way). For the *is-this-the-command* decision, prefer a
  narrow **regex** (`git` and `commit` as separate words, any flag tokens between)
  that's immune to multi-line-quote breakage; reserve the shlex walker for the
  *command-position / modifier* checks where fail-open is the safe direction.

### 2. Test with **bash -n + a real JSON event, end-to-end, BEFORE registering**

**A corrupted or wrong-logic PreToolUse hook poisons the *entire* session** —
every later Bash call gets truncated / duplicated / falsely-failed / looks
hallucinated-executed, and you'll blame "the environment" when it's the hook you
just installed. (2026-07-05: a `[^;&|]` regex broke in one edit, `;&` became a
bash case-fallthrough token, poisoned half a session until `bash -n` found it.)
"My tests passed at deploy" isn't enough — the file can corrupt in a *later* edit.

Gate before registering ANY hook:
```bash
bash -n hook.sh                                # syntax
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<trigger case>"}}'    | ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 2
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<healthy lookalike>"}}'| ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 0
```
Bundle the harness: [scripts/test_hook.sh](scripts/test_hook.sh) runs a whole
table of trigger/allow cases. **Self-block gotcha:** once the hook is live in the
session you cannot test it by putting the trigger string in your *own* Bash
command — the live hook blocks your test command. Put the cases in a **script
file** and run `bash test_hook.sh`; the outer command doesn't contain the
trigger, so it isn't self-blocked.

### 3. SSOT + symlink so a reinstall can't silently disarm the guard

Real script in a version-controlled dir, **symlinked** into the hooks dir Claude reads:
```
~/scripts/claude-hooks/<name>.sh      # SSOT (git: private repo)
~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh             # symlink → SSOT
```
A `~/.claude` reinstall wipes the hooks dir; the symlink target survives, and
recovery is one `ln -s`. A dangling symlink disables a Tier-0 guard with **zero
signal** — which is why a SessionStart health check exists (rule 4).

### 4. Registration is per-profile — converge ALL profiles, release via a HUMAN gate

- A hook in `~/.claude/hooks/` protects **nothing** if the *active profile's*
  `settings.json` doesn't call it. Multi-profile users ran with zero guards until
  every profile was converged. Register in the **main** profile's `settings.json`
  (PreToolUse → matcher `Bash` → your hook), then converge the rest (this setup
  uses `sync-profile-settings.py --all`, owned by the `claude-switch-models-setup`
  skill). A SessionStart health check greps each profile for the Tier-0 guards to
  catch drift.
- **If the guard needs a release valve, make it a *human* gate, not an env var.**
  A static `GUARD_OK=1` escape hatch is no gate — the model can set the env var
  itself. Replace with: a native macOS dialog (`osascript` — model can't click)
  and/or a typed `YES` on `/dev/tty` (model can't type into the user's terminal);
  refuse/cancel/timeout = hard NO; log every prompt/bypass to an audit file.
  Pattern in [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

## Build order (in sequence)

1. **Confirm it's a real recurrence**, not hypothetical — else don't build it.
2. Write the script in the SSOT dir; `chmod +x`.
3. **Detection** with shlex token-level matching (rule 1).
4. **`bash -n` + `test_hook.sh`** with trigger AND healthy-lookalike cases (rule 2) — do not register until green.
5. **Symlink** into `~/.claude/hooks/` (rule 3).
6. **Register** in main `settings.json` + converge profiles (rule 4).
7. For a Tier-0/irreversible action, add the **human-confirmation release gate** (rule 4).
8. **Persist**: commit the SSOT to its private repo. Optionally add a CLAUDE.md line (prose says *why* + the alternative; the hook enforces).

## Known pitfalls (read before debugging a misfiring hook)

Full catalog with symptom → cause → fix: [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md).
Headliners: `stdin` consumed by a `python3 - <<PY` heredoc (hook silently allows
everything), awk-split false-blocks (rule 1), corrupted hook poisoning the session
(rule 2), static env escape hatch (rule 4), multi-profile under-registration.
