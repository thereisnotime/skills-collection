"""Name-convergence guard: fail-closed gate against collapsing a person name
onto a phonetic neighbour whose target form nothing in the library claims.

Real incident 2026-09-16: an agent normalized 依琳→依林 and 徐盛→徐胜 by
transcript-majority spelling; both targets were wrong (the group-chat
displayName said so afterwards), and the error reached a pushed commit before
anyone re-read the roster. triage / accept / --add all ran on agent
discretion, and discretion is exactly what failed. This module is the
mechanical gate that discretion used to be: it fires at the two write points
(`--resolve-review --decision accepted|overridden`, and `--add` when the new
mapping is person-name shaped) and refuses the write when the target is
either someone else's recorded ASR variant or a string no store knows.

The gate asks four questions, in order, first hit decides:

a. Is the target a roster entry name (### header) or the to_text of an ACTIVE
   dictionary rule?  -> PASS: the form is already claimed as somebody's
   canonical form; converging onto a claimed form is the normal correction.
b. Is the target ONLY someone's roster ASR variant?  -> REJECT, naming the
   canonical: a variant is a recorded mishearing, so rewriting text onto it
   manufactures the error the roster exists to fix.
c. Is the target found NOWHERE (dictionary / roster / context rules / review
   queue, --lookup semantics) AND the evidence names no authority source?
   -> REJECT: majority-spelling convergence onto an unclaimed string is the
   incident shape verbatim. The remediation is written into the message:
   enqueue kind:entity, or name the authority (roster line / group
   displayName+nickName double-read / user ruling / audio evidence).
d. Otherwise (target claimed somewhere, or evidence names an authority)
   -> PASS.

Everything the guard needs to know about the library arrives through the
injected ``lookup_fn`` so the decision logic stays pure and unit-testable;
the CLI wires the production lookup (dictionary + roster + context rules +
review queue).
