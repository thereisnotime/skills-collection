description: >-
  Corrects speech-to-text transcription errors with dictionary rules and Claude's built-in AI (no external API key required); Native AI Correction is the default, Stage 1 alone is incomplete, and Stage 3 API is only for automation without Claude Code. Builds personalized correction databases, loads person-name ASR variants from the configured global people roster, and reads per-domain contexts for homophones. Before correcting a person name, the agent must consult both the global roster and the owning project's identity roster; project rosters are not auto-loaded, and occurrence frequency is never identity evidence. Use for ASR/STT output with recognition errors, homophones, garbled technical terms, person-name errors, or mixed Chinese/English, and for cleaning meeting notes, lecture transcripts, interviews, or any speech-recognition text—even when the user only says “fix this transcript,” “clean up these meeting notes,” or mentions a garbled name.

# Transcript Fixer

Use a two-phase loop:

1. Stage 1 applies deterministic, already-known corrections.
2. Native AI Correction reads the complete transcript, fixes one-off errors, verifies uncertain entities, and compounds reusable fixes.

**Native AI Correction is the default. Stage 1 alone is incomplete.** Stage 3 API exists only for automation that has no Claude/Codex agent available.

## Operating contract

- Finish Stage 1 → Native AI Correction → compound confirmed recurring fixes. Do not report a transcript clean after Stage 1 alone.
- Skip Native AI only when the human explicitly limits this run to the dictionary pass or a dated artifact proves Native AI already ran on this exact transcript.
- In Claude Code or Codex, do not run Stage 3. Use Stage 1 plus the native workflow.
- Never rewrite speech for fluency. A correction must explain a plausible ASR error and preserve who said what.
- Never infer or reassign speaker identities. Preserve speaker-label lines; human-confirmed labels and user verdicts are authoritative.
- Before correcting any person name, directly read both the configured global people roster and the owning project's explicit identity roster or alias ledger. Stage 1 auto-loads only global `ASR 变体` entries; it does not load project rosters or expose suppressed, disabled, and unlisted entries. If an expected source is missing or the sources conflict, leave the name unchanged and enqueue or ask once. Never use occurrence frequency as identity evidence. Read [references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md](references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md) before settling the name.
- Leave unresolved text unchanged and enqueue it. A visible garble is safer than a fluent wrong guess.
- Treat a single-line `asr_note` value as correction provenance: it intentionally cites old forms and is excluded from matching. Multi-line YAML ledger values are not masked; keywords, titles, other ASR-derived metadata, and body text remain in correction scope.
- Read [references/native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md) in full before performing a native pass. Read the task-specific references named below before their corresponding action.

## Run context

Run every entrypoint through `uv run`; entrypoints that need third-party Python packages declare them with PEP 723, while stdlib/internal-only utilities may omit the metadata block. Execute commands from the skill directory printed when this skill was invoked, or prefix every script path with that directory. Do not rely on `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR`; it is not available in every harness.

If the bundle location is genuinely unknown, use the installation-resolution procedure in [references/installation_setup.md](references/installation_setup.md). Do not select the first result from a broad `find`: caches, backups, and old versions can coexist.

## Quick start

~~~bash
# Initialize once
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init

# Stage 1 for one project domain. --apply-domain trusts that explicitly
# selected, human-curated project domain at every risk level.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 \
  --domain myproject --apply-domain --json

# Several sibling domains may be loaded as one union.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 \
  --domain myproject,myproject-alt --apply-domain --json

# Preview without writing the Stage 1 output.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 --domain myproject --dry-run

# Scan all documented context traps after the native read-through.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --scan-traps \
  --context-file ~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/myproject.md \
  --input meeting.md
~~~

Safe mode is the Stage 1 default: low-risk rules apply; medium/high-risk matches defer to `*_needs_review.md` and the persistent review queue. `Applied: 0` is a valid result, not proof that the transcript is clean.

The Stage 1 JSON contract is:

~~~json
{
  "applied": 0,
  "deferred": 0,
  "output_path": null,
  "needs_review_path": null,
  "input_unchanged": true,
  "review_enqueued": 0,
  "stage1_only_incomplete": true,
  "stage2_total_chunks": 0,
  "stage2_failed_chunks": 0,
  "stage2_degraded": false
}
~~~

Read all ten fields. `stage1_only_incomplete` is additive to the original six-field caller contract and must remain true for a Stage 1 script run; only the caller can close it by running Native AI, or by explicitly choosing the agent-less Stage 2/3 route. The three `stage2_*` telemetry fields are always present: Stage 1 reports `0`, `0`, and `false`; Stage 2/3 replace them with the actual API outcome. Do not infer no-op or success from whether a sidecar exists.

For a native end-to-end example, read [references/example_session_dji_minutes.md](references/example_session_dji_minutes.md).

## Choose the route

| Route | Use when | Required reading |
|---|---|---|
| Fast native | Short/plain transcript, known speakers, low stakes | This file + [native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md) |
| Full native | Domain-heavy, unfamiliar entities, 3+ speakers, long or decision-bearing transcript | [native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md), plus queue and evidence references below |
| Caller integration | Another skill or ingest pipeline invokes Stage 1 | `Cross-skill caller contract` below |
| Review queue/dashboard | Any item is uncertain or needs audio | [review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md) |
| Agent-less API | CI/batch automation with no agent available | [glm_api_setup.md](references/glm_api_setup.md) and [workflow_guide.md](references/workflow_guide.md) |
| Multi-file batch | Several related transcripts; especially 10+ files | [advanced_correction_evidence.md](references/advanced_correction_evidence.md) |

Use vocabulary and stakes as the primary tier signals; use length only as a tiebreaker. A five-minute medical interview can require the full tier, while a long plain two-person memo can use the fast tier.

## Native correction checklist

1. **Give the file its final name before Stage 1.** Queue anchors store absolute paths. Use a human-readable project filename before any deferral can enqueue. When the input arrives as inline text with no file yet — a slash-command argument, a pasted block — write it to a file before anything else; `--input` and the queue anchors both need a path, and a scratch location is fine when nothing downstream will archive it. No `--domain` given and none obvious from context? Omitting the flag already defaults to searching every domain (`--domain`'s own default), so don't block on picking one — run Stage 1 bare and let safe mode gate what auto-applies. If a specific candidate still needs resolving, one step of the ladder is cheap enough to keep even at fast tier though the rest of it isn't: native_ai_full_workflow.md step 4's rung 1, a single cross-domain `corrections.db` lookup — not the full verification ladder the tier table tells you to skip, just that one query.
2. **Recover the raw baseline before reading a pre-corrected transcript.** If an ingest pipeline or previous API pass already touched the text, diff against the raw source first. Judge upstream edits as edits, not as ground truth.
3. **Load project priors and read the complete transcript.** Read `~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/<domain>.md` when present, then read the whole file before deciding early ambiguities.
4. **Run Stage 1 and inspect the real result.** Prefer explicit project domains plus `--apply-domain --json`. Read `deferred` and `review_enqueued`; never silently discard the sidecar or queue gap.
5. **Diff Stage 1 against raw/original.** If a rule changed correct speech, work from the original, retire the stored pair with `--report-false-positive "<from>" "<to>" --domain <domain>`, and verify it no longer fires.
6. **Triage every candidate.**
   - Confident: the sound change is plausible and context or an authoritative local source settles it.
   - Needs verification: a person, company, product, model, ticker, place, number, or other load-bearing term without a source.
   - Uncertain: evidence does not settle it; leave the original and enqueue.
   - Multi-channel entity fork: when independent transcripts disagree on a person name or other proper noun and no local authority settles it, collect the unresolved forks and ask the human once. Do not guess, and do not treat a majority vote as identity evidence.
7. **Apply the smallest edit that explains the sound.** Do not add words the speaker did not say. Correct ASR-derived metadata too, while leaving `asr_note` intact.
8. **Run a second pass.**
   - Every tier: run `--scan-traps` and inspect both hits and `unparsed`.
   - Full tier: use a fresh-context reviewer on exactly one corrected file. Require a compact residual table or explicit `no new residuals`; an empty/truncated response is a failed review.
   - High-stakes multi-recording: a sampled clip settles only that anchored item. If the user asked for a higher-quality or complete transcript and the baseline audio is available, load **`/daymade-audio:asr-transcribe-to-text`** and run its full-file transcription path across the complete clearest/canonical recording before claiming whole-transcript coverage; otherwise report `sampled cross-check only — incomplete`. Prefer a recognizer different from the producer of the canonical body. If only the same recognizer is available, the run proves complete-source coverage but is not independent cross-recognizer corroboration; state that boundary.
9. **Enqueue every unresolved item and open only this file.** Follow `Review queue safety` below and [review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md). Detection and enqueueing are not correction: for a higher-quality/final claim, every queue row anchored to this exact file must leave `pending`. Start the dashboard with `uv run scripts/review-dashboard/server.py --file "<absolute-canonical-file>"`; add `--item <id>` to land on one fork. If a human is unavailable, keep the artifact explicitly labeled `draft / unresolved — incomplete` and enumerate the rows; do not ship the raw suspect text under a completed quality claim.
10. **Read back the human state, then finalize.** When the human says they marked the dashboard, do not rerun ASR or ask the same questions again. First run `uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --list-review --review-file "<absolute-canonical-file>" --review-status all --json`, apply any resulting file state, and require `stats.pending_total == 0` for that exact path; zero pending rows is required before the high-quality/final claim. Then diff the file actually edited, run numeric consistency when numbers matter, rerun plain Stage 1, re-grep known corrections, and confirm every change traces to a triage decision. Global queue counts cannot close or reopen this file's quality claim.
11. **Compound the learning in the same turn.** Route each stable pattern to its correct home; do not leave confirmed fixes only in chat. Native-pass edits never reach Stage 1's correction history, so harvest them mechanically right after the final diff:

    ~~~bash
    # Diff raw vs corrected into parseable trap candidates (review artifact —
    # you adjudicate the printed list; --write auto-appends only the recurring
    # (≥2x) non-bare candidates; --write-all also appends the one-off set)
    uv run scripts/harvest_corrections.py raw.md corrected.md \
      --context-file ~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/<domain>.md
    ~~~

    Every emitted bullet is round-trip verified through the real trap parser before printing, and pairs already documented in the context file are skipped. High-frequency candidates are strong traps; single-occurrence ones need a human judgment — that is why `--write` leaves them out by default — and ⚠️ 裸形 candidates are never auto-written. This replaces hand-writing trap bullets from memory.
12. **Propagate entity fixes deliberately.** Search only the owning project’s derived notes/summaries, review every hit, and exclude raw ASR and correction sidecars because they preserve the evidence trail.

The detailed provenance bar, local-first entity ladder, second-pass prompt, queue payload, and finalization rules are in [references/native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md).

## Cross-skill caller contract

A caller pipeline has two independent obligations:

1. Run Stage 1 with the explicitly configured project domain(s), `--apply-domain`, and `--json`. If `deferred > review_enqueued`, persist the review sidecar outside any temporary directory or surface the gap as failure.
2. Run Native AI with this skill loaded, or report `Stage 1 only — incomplete`. Agent-less automation may use Stage 3 instead.

Canonical call:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input "$staged" --stage 1 \
  --domain "$domains" --apply-domain --json
~~~

A caller that wires only the script path never loads this contract. Script-path integration alone is therefore a Stage 1 prefilter, not transcript correction.

Keep project domains warm: every confirmed recurring correction from the native pass must be added back to the correct project domain, roster, or context file.

## Dictionary and identity safety

Read [references/false_positive_guide.md](references/false_positive_guide.md) and [references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md](references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md) before adding a rule.

| Pattern | Destination |
|---|---|
| Stable non-word or unique garble → canonical term | `--add ... --domain <project>` |
| Important recurring person and observed ASR variants | People roster |
| Correction right only inside a specific recurring phrase | `--add-context-rule PATTERN REPLACEMENT --domain <project>` (regex, domain-scoped; omit `--domain` for global) |
| Common/real word wrong only under a cue | Domain context trap, never a bare rule |
| Real name → different real name | Domain context + human/audio verification, never a bare rule |
| Confirmed-correct entity repeatedly reopened | Confirmed-correct context record |
| One-off sentence-local wording | Edit only; do not add |

A context trap is a cue, not permission to replace blindly. Two annotation classes in a domain context file are **machine-readable vetoes that Stage 1 enforces** (when the domain is named via `--domain` — a whole-library run has no owner to veto with): a trap marked `禁裸词`/`禁入词典` demotes any dictionary rule with the same FROM to review, and a confirmed-correct （勿修） record demotes any rule whose FROM is that token — demotion beats `--apply-domain` trust-flattening, so a real-word rule (the 绿点→绿电 class: right in business context, wrong in UI context) can stay in the dictionary without firing blindly. `--apply-all` remains the operator's explicit override. Without the veto the only escape was `--report-false-positive`, which disables the rule in the contexts where it is right too. `--scan-traps` supports canonical `→` and legacy `≈` mappings with the same directional contract: left is observed ASR, right is intended text. Wrap an exact FROM phrase containing spaces in backticks:

~~~markdown
- **`CC 思维链`/`CC 思维连` → 目标术语** — only under the domain's documented cue
~~~

This demonstrates an exact ASR phrase candidate, not a person-name candidate. The domain context remains the authority for the real target and cue; the scanner only locates the literal FROM forms.

Before adding any real-word-shaped rule, measure the project corpus:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --probe "candidate" --corpus /path/to/project-transcripts/

uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --add "candidate" "canonical" --domain myproject \
  --check-corpus --corpus /path/to/project-transcripts/
~~~

User verdicts settle the occurrence immediately, but they do not make a replacement reusable. Fix the file first, then route the result through the table above: only a stable recurring pattern goes to the dictionary/roster/context; a rare sentence-local mishearing stays file-only. When the user confirms that two legitimate names or nicknames identify the same person, preserve whichever form was actually spoken and store the identity relationship as context, not as a replacement rule.

## Review queue safety

Read [references/review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md) before enqueueing or resolving.

Minimum item:

~~~json
[
  {
    "file": "/absolute/path/to/transcript.md",
    "line": 142,
    "original": "<suspect-token-only>",
    "suggested": "<best-candidate>",
    "kind": "entity",
    "context": "<verbatim whole sentence>",
    "evidence": "<what was checked>"
  }
]
~~~

Safety rules:

- `file` is mandatory for this workflow. Without it, acceptance can record a verdict without editing the transcript.
- `original` is only the suspect token/span; never put the whole sentence there.
- `context` is copied verbatim; `line` is the key, not `line_hint`.
- `suggested` is the key, not `suggestion`. Use `actions`, not `action_pack`.
- Resolve one occurrence at a time; sweep sibling entity occurrences only after the whole batch is resolved.
- A `pending` row is a blocking state for a high-quality/final transcript, not proof that the issue was handled. Queue detection without a human/evidence verdict leaves the artifact incomplete.
- Read `resolved_text` after an override; the listing can still display the rejected suggestion.
- If the file moved or drifted, run `--reanchor-review`. Add `--reanchor-root` or `--reanchor-to` when requested. Do not hand-edit around a pending item.
- Promote every `decision_note` by meaning; storing a note does not change the dictionary, roster, context, or false-positive state.

Core commands:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --enqueue-review items.json
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --list-review --review-file "<absolute-canonical-file>" \
  --review-status all --json
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --show-review <id> --json
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --reanchor-review <id>
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --resolve-review <id> --decision accepted --by reviewer
~~~

## Numbers, artifacts, and batches

Read [references/advanced_correction_evidence.md](references/advanced_correction_evidence.md) when any of these conditions holds:

- A number, bound, price, share, deadline, or magnitude drives a decision.
- Two recordings exist for one meeting.
- A whiteboard, slide, or photographed written artifact can independently settle a name/term.
- Several related files should share one correction list.
- A 10+ file batch is being delegated.

Numeric-slot scan:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/scan_numeric_consistency.py transcript.md --domain myproject
~~~

Its output is candidates, never automatic edits. For a single load-bearing number, wire the original audio and decide by ear through the review dashboard.

For delegated batches, every agent owns one file, cannot cross-file replace, and returns a residual list. Afterward compare `git diff --name-only` with the explicit file list and inspect every unexpected file under the repository's worktree-safety rules.

## Finalization

- Native mode edits the original file directly. Rerun plain `--stage 1` to confirm; a clean no-op writes no Stage 1 sidecar.
- When a newer `*_stage1.md` exists and the original was not edited after it, a plain Stage 1 rerun atomically promotes it and removes disposable sidecars. It retains `*_changes.md` and `*_needs_review.md` because only the reviewer can know that every associated decision is closed. `--apply-all` never takes this promotion path.
- Do not use the existence of an output file as the success signal; read JSON/exit status and independently read the final file.
- Preserve raw transcripts, `*_changes.md`, and `*_needs_review.md` as evidence until every associated decision is closed.
- Re-grep a known corrected form in the final file and verify no correction remains only in `asr_note` or a sidecar.
- If a queued item was renamed away, repair it with `--reanchor-review` rather than resolving it with a false terminal verdict.

## Agent-less API route

Only when no Claude/Codex agent can perform Native AI Correction:

~~~bash
export GLM_API_KEY="<api-key>"
uv run scripts/fix_transcript_enhanced.py input.md --output ./corrected
~~~

Read [references/glm_api_setup.md](references/glm_api_setup.md), [references/installation_setup.md](references/installation_setup.md), and the explicitly API-oriented portions of [references/workflow_guide.md](references/workflow_guide.md). When a chunk fails after retries, the API route keeps that chunk and its original surrounding separators byte-for-byte and prints a warning; if every chunk fails, the complete output equals the input. For `fix_transcription.py --stage 2|3 --json`, read the additive `stage2_total_chunks`, `stage2_failed_chunks`, and `stage2_degraded` fields: `stage2_degraded: true` is not a fully corrected run even though the safely retained artifact is emitted. The enhanced wrapper exits nonzero after writing that retained artifact when any Stage 2 chunk is degraded. Verify the output rather than assuming the warning means a corrected result exists.

The enhanced API wrapper can also add paragraph breaks, reduce repeated filler,
and present corrections for interactive review. Those are API-wrapper features;
they do not authorize Native AI to rewrite wording for fluency.

## Handoff

After correction, hand off to `/daymade-audio:meeting-minutes-taker` only when the user wants a structured summary. Do not create meeting minutes automatically: transcript correction and summarization are separate scopes.
