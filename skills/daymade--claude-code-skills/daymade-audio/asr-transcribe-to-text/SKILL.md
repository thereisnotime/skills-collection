  Transcribe audio/video to speaker-labeled text — who-said-what by default, plain-text opt-out; MLX-local on Apple Silicon or remote; local files, media URLs.

This skill ALSO owns audio PREPROCESSING for ASR as a first-class trigger, even without transcription: convert any audio/video into an ASR-ready file (转换成适合 ASR 的格式, 转格式, convert/prepare audio for ASR, 音频预处理), downsample to 16kHz mono 16-bit (降采样, 重采样, 单声道, 归一化), merge multi-segment recorder dumps (多段合并/拼接, DJI TX01/TX02), transcode to small M4A + pitch-preserved speedup to cut metered-ASR billed minutes (转 M4A, 压缩上传, 加速, 1.3x, 飞书妙记/Feishu Minutes). Trigger even when it looks like a trivial one-line ffmpeg — the skill owns sample-rate/bit-depth/channel, merge-order, speed-vs-WER, format choices + a blessed prepare_asr_input.py.

# ASR Transcribe to Text

Transcribe audio/video to **speaker-labeled** text. Default pipeline (decoupled,
WhisperX-style): Qwen3-ASR transcribes the full audio with context intact,
mlx-whisper supplies a word-level timing lattice, pyannote supplies speaker
segments, and an aligner merges the three — the audio is never cut before ASR,
so transcription quality stays at full-audio fidelity.

| Mode | When | Speed | Cost |
|------|------|-------|------|
| **Local MLX** | macOS Apple Silicon | 15-27x realtime | Free |
| **Remote API** | Any platform, or when local unavailable | Depends on GPU | API/self-hosted |

**Choosing between them is usually not about speed — it's about where the audio already
is.** A remote GPU can be several times faster (a 4090 running vLLM measured ~61x realtime
against ~15x for local MLX), but that gap is small change next to moving the files:
transcription output is text, and text is ~10,000× smaller than the audio it came from
(18.5 h of speech ≈ 330 K characters ≈ 1 MB, from ~2.6 GB of WAV). So:

> **Transcribe where the audio already lives, and move only the transcript.**

Pulling a few hundred MB across a slow link to reach a faster GPU routinely costs more
wall-clock than the entire transcription — measured once at 63 KB/s, which is over two
hours for 500 MB, to save minutes of compute. If the recording is already on the remote
box (it was recorded there, downloaded there, or lives in a share mounted there), run the
ASR there and bring back the `.txt`.

Configuration persists in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json`.

> **Speaker labels are the default.** Every run produces `[start-end] SPEAKER_xx: text`
> + CSV. Plain-text-only output is the opt-out (`--no-diarization`) for monologues,
> podcasts, or when you just want a summary — see Step 3.
>
> **One-time setup for diarization:** pyannote is a gated HuggingFace model — it
> needs a token once (`## Speaker Diarization & Identification` below). First run
> without it FAILS with setup steps; after setup, full capability is permanent
> and auto-detected.

## Step 0: Detect Platform and Load Config

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json" 2>/dev/null
```

**If config exists**, read values and proceed to Step 1.

**If config does not exist**, auto-detect platform first:

```bash
python3 -c "
import sys, platform
is_mac_arm = sys.platform == 'darwin' and platform.machine() in ('arm64', 'aarch64')
print(f'Platform: {sys.platform} {platform.machine()}')
print(f'Apple Silicon: {is_mac_arm}')
if is_mac_arm:
    print('RECOMMEND: local-mlx')
else:
    print('RECOMMEND: remote-api')
"
```

Then use **AskUserQuestion** with platform-aware defaults:

For **macOS Apple Silicon** (recommended: local):
```
ASR setup — your Mac has Apple Silicon, so local transcription is recommended.

Q1: Transcription mode?
  A) Local MLX — runs on your Mac's GPU, no API key needed, 15-27x realtime (Recommended)
  B) Remote API — send audio to a server (vLLM, Tailscale workstation, etc.)

Q2: Does your network have an HTTP proxy that might intercept traffic?
  A) Yes — bypass proxy for ASR traffic (Recommended if using Shadowrocket/Clash)
  B) No — direct connection
```

For **other platforms** (recommended: remote):
```
ASR setup — local MLX requires macOS Apple Silicon. Using remote API mode.

Q1: ASR Endpoint URL?
  A) https://asr.example.com/v1/audio/transcriptions (Self-hosted remote ASR)
  B) http://localhost:8002/v1/audio/transcriptions (Local ASR server)
  C) Custom URL

Q2: Proxy bypass needed?
  A) Yes (Recommended for Shadowrocket/Clash/corporate proxy)
  B) No
```

Save config:
```bash
mkdir -p "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}"
python3 -c "
import json
config = {
    'mode': 'MODE',           # 'local-mlx' or 'remote-api'
    'model': 'MODEL_ID',      # local: 'mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-8bit', remote: 'Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B'
    'max_tokens': 200000,     # local only, critical for long audio
    'endpoint': 'URL',        # remote only
    'noproxy': True,
    'max_timeout': 900        # remote only
    # 'diarization_declined': True  # set only after the user explicitly declines
    #   the pyannote setup in Step 3 — every run then warns + goes plain-text
    #   until an HF token appears (auto-detected)
}
with open('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(config, f, indent=2)
print('Config saved.')
"
```

## Step 1: Resolve Input

Accept local files, direct media URLs, or web/podcast episode pages.

- **Web or podcast page URL**: inspect the page for an existing transcript first. Use an official/platform transcript only when it is directly accessible to the user's account. If the transcript endpoint requires a login token and none is available, say that clearly and fall back to ASR from the audio URL.
- **Local file, direct media URL, or page URL fallback**: run the bundled resolver. It extracts media from common page metadata (`og:audio`, media tags, JSON-LD, RSS-style enclosure links), downloads URLs with atomic temp-file replacement, verifies remote `Content-Length` when present, computes SHA-256, and validates the result with `ffprobe`.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_media_input.py \
  INPUT_FILE_OR_URL [INPUT_FILE_OR_URL2 ...] \
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR \
  --manifest OUTPUT_DIR/media_manifest.json
```

For suspicious or high-value downloads, add `--decode-check` to make `ffmpeg` decode the whole file before transcription:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_media_input.py \
  "https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/EPISODE_ID" \
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR \
  --manifest OUTPUT_DIR/media_manifest.json \
  --decode-check
```

Expected output:

```text
Downloaded ... bytes in ...s -> OUTPUT_DIR/episode-title.m4a
OUTPUT_DIR/episode-title.m4a
```

Use the printed local path as `INPUT_AUDIO` in later steps. If your runtime shows the literal `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` instead of a substituted path, resolve the skill directory per the Troubleshooting entry at the bottom of this document.

For third-party public podcasts or copyrighted media, save the transcript as a local file for the user's personal analysis. Do not paste a full long transcript into chat; provide a path, previews, summaries, or short excerpts instead.

## Step 2: Extract Audio (if input is video)

For video files (mp4, mov, mkv, avi, webm), extract as 16kHz mono WAV:

```bash
ffmpeg -i INPUT_VIDEO -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 OUTPUT.wav -y
```

Audio files (wav, mp3, m4a, flac, ogg) can be used directly. Get duration:
```bash
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 INPUT_FILE
```

**Cleanup**: After transcription succeeds, delete extracted WAV files to save disk space.

## Preprocess: Merge Segments & Shrink Metered Uploads (optional)

Run this BEFORE transcription when either applies:

- **The recording is a multi-segment dump** — body mics and field recorders split
  sessions into fixed-length files (e.g. `TX02_MIC024_....wav`, `TX02_MIC025_....wav`;
  `TX01/TX02` = DJI MIC MINI 2S internal recording — device roster and the
  recorder→Feishu-Minutes paths: the meeting-ingest skill's `meeting-ingest/references/architecture.md` §①-L0).
  Merge them and transcribe the merged file: full-audio context is the quality basis
  of the decoupled pipeline (Step 3), so transcribing segments separately throws away
  exactly what the architecture buys.
- **The audio goes to a metered ASR** (Feishu Minutes, any per-minute quota) — a
  pitch-PRESERVED speedup cuts billed duration directly, and modern ASR does not care:
  1.3x was user-verified on Feishu Minutes (2026-07-16) with no perceptible recognition
  difference, and public Whisper benchmarks show no sharp WER drop until 2.0x
  (≤1.5x = safe zone, ~3% WER increase at 1.5x; >2x unusable).

Use the bundled script — it merges, normalizes to 16 kHz mono, optionally speeds up,
and verifies its own output instead of trusting the ffmpeg exit code:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prepare_asr_input.py SEG1.wav SEG2.wav -o merged.wav   # merge only
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prepare_asr_input.py SEG*.wav -o upload.m4a --speed 1.3  # merge + quota-saving speedup
```

Expected output:

```text
Merge order:
  1. SEG1.wav  [pcm_s24le 48000Hz ch=1 1800.14s]
  2. SEG2.wav  [pcm_s24le 48000Hz ch=1 1800.15s]
[OK] duration: 4946.19s vs expected 4946.18s (delta +0.00s)
[OK] boundary 1 @ 1384.7s: max_volume -15.5 dB
[info] overall: mean_volume -38.3 dB, max_volume 0.0 dB
Wrote upload.m4a
```

- Segments sort by the `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` timestamp embedded in their filenames when
  every file has one (recorder dumps do); otherwise the given order is kept with a note —
  eyeball the printed merge order before transcribing.
- Self-verification: output duration must equal Σsegments ÷ speed (±1.5 s, hard FAIL
  otherwise); each splice gets a 10 s volume spot-check (dead air at a boundary = wrong
  order or a missing segment); overall loudness prints for comparison with the source.
- Speedup must be `atempo`-style pitch-preserved stretch — never sample-rate trickery,
  which shifts pitch and breaks both ASR accuracy and diarization voiceprints.
- **Pick the output format by destination** — codec follows the file extension:

  | Destination | Format | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | Local MLX pipeline (Path A) | `.wav` or `.m4a` | Both feed the pipeline directly (m4a verified 2026-07-18: a 3-min slice transcribed cleanly). M4A is ~5x smaller — 324 MB WAV → 63 MB M4A on a 2h49m merge, duration identical to the second |
  | Metered upload (Feishu Minutes, per-minute quota) | `.m4a` + `--speed 1.3` | AAC 48k is speech-transparent for ASR, ~30% smaller than mp3 at equal speech quality; speedup cuts billed duration ~23% |
  | Self-hosted vLLM endpoint (Path B) | `.ogg` | Accepted where MP3 is refused, and ~8× smaller than WAV — which is what keeps a long recording under the server's 25 MB request cap. See Path B's limits section |
  | Lossless archive | `.flac` | ~50% of WAV, bit-perfect |
  | Only when the target rejects the above | `.mp3` | Compatibility fallback |
- Keep the originals until the transcript passes Step 4 verification.

## Option: Upload to Feishu Minutes for transcription

After preprocessing, if the user wants **Feishu Minutes** to do the transcription
instead of the local/remote pipeline above, use this path. This is the right
choice when the user explicitly asks for a 妙记 minute or wants the cloud
transcription UI rather than a local transcript file.

**Trigger phrases**: 传到妙记 / 上传到飞书妙记 / 让妙记转写 / create a minute from this audio / upload to Feishu minutes.

**Constraints**:
- **No proxy**: all `lark-cli` calls must use `LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1`.
- **Single profile**: use the active Feishu profile only. Do not iterate tenant
  profiles or invoke tenant routing.
- **No local transcription follows**: once the minute is created, this skill's
  job ends here. The user opens the `minute_url` in Feishu and waits for the
  cloud ASR. Local transcript correction (`transcript-fixer`) or speaker
  backfill (`review-feishu-minutes`) only apply after the cloud transcript exists
  and has been pulled back, not at create time.

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Use the already-preprocessed audio** from the section above when possible.
   Feishu accepts `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac` in an MP4/MOV wrapper; the
   preprocessor's "Metered upload" row is already shaped for this. Keep the file
   under 6 GB and under 6 hours — those are Feishu upload hard limits.

2. **Upload to Drive as the user**:
   ```bash
   LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1 lark-cli drive +upload \
     --file '<preprocessed-media-path>' \
     --name '<basename>' \
     --as user \
     --format json
   ```
   From the result, record `file_token`. If the command errors with a path
   validation or multipart failure, do not retry blindly — switch format or size
   strategy and try once more, then report the exact failure.

3. **Create the minute from that Drive file**:
   ```bash
   LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1 lark-cli minutes +upload \
     --file-token '<file_token>' \
     --as user \
     --format json
   ```
   From the result, record `minute_token` and `minute_url`.

4. **Return the `minute_url` to the user** and stop. Do not run this skill's
   local transcription steps, and do not run `sync-feishu-minutes` ingest/delegate
   for this newly created minute — those are for minutes that already existed on
   Feishu. When the user later asks to pull this minute back, hand off to
   **`sync-feishu-minutes`**; for speaker cleanup after that, hand off to
   **`review-feishu-minutes`**.

**Expected output**:
- Success: a single `minute_url` the user can open to view/transcribe.
- Failure: exact API error from `drive +upload` or `minutes +upload`, plus one
  suggested next action.

**Wrong-skill recovery**: if this request lands while you are inside
`sync-feishu-minutes`, the request shape is "local audio -> Feishu minute", not
"sync existing minutes" — stop, switch to `asr-transcribe-to-text`, and follow
this section.

## Step 3: Transcribe (speaker labels by default)

### Path A: Local MLX (macOS Apple Silicon) — default

Run the decoupled speaker pipeline — it handles dependency pins, model loading,
and the critical `max_tokens` parameter internally.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/speaker_transcribe.py \
  INPUT_AUDIO [INPUT_AUDIO2 ...] OUTPUT_DIR
```

Expected output (per file):

```text
Device: mps
+ uv run .../transcribe_local_mlx.py ...        (leg 1: full-audio text)
+ uv run .../word_timestamps_whisper.py ...     (leg 2: timing lattice)
... diarization ...                             (leg 3: pyannote segments)
STEM: 42 turns, speakers=['SPEAKER_00', 'SPEAKER_01'], anchored_ratio=0.93
Wrote STEM.txt, STEM.csv, STEM.alignment.json
```

Outputs per input: `<stem>.txt` (`[MM:SS - MM:SS] SPEAKER_xx` + text),
`<stem>.csv` (`file,start,end,duration,speaker,text` — feeds review UIs and
voiceprint ID), `<stem>.diarization.json`, `<stem>.alignment.json` (provenance
+ `anchored_ratio` trust signal; < 0.5 prints a loud warning — verify labels
against the audio before trusting them). Intermediate legs are cached in
`OUTPUT_DIR/_align/` so re-runs are cheap (`--force` redoes them).

Before a long first run, smoke-test the Qwen3 leg once:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/transcribe_local_mlx.py --smoke-test
```

Expected output includes `Dependency stack: mlx-audio 0.3.1, mlx-lm 0.30.5,
transformers 5.0.0rc3` and `Smoke test OK`. For performance details and the
max_tokens truncation issue, see `references/local_mlx_guide.md`.

**How it works (and why):** full-audio Qwen3-ASR text + mlx-whisper word
timestamps + pyannote speaker segments, aligned after the fact — the audio is
never cut before transcription, so ASR keeps full context. Architecture,
alignment algorithm, and failure modes: `references/decoupled_speaker_alignment.md`.

**First run: pyannote needs a one-time HuggingFace token.** If the script exits
with the setup hint (exit code 3), STOP and use **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Speaker diarization needs a one-time setup (gated model, free):
  1. Accept terms at https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
  2. Run `huggingface-cli login` (or set HF_TOKEN)

Options:
A) Set it up now — I'll wait, then rerun with full speaker labels (Recommended)
B) Continue without speakers this time — plain text only
```

- **A** → after the user confirms login, rerun the same command. The token is
  auto-detected every run; full capability is permanent from then on.
- **B** → persist the choice (`diarization_declined: true` in config.json) and
  rerun the SAME command. The script detects the flag, prints a one-line warning
  with the two setup steps, and auto-falls back to plain text for that run —
  no need to pass `--no-diarization` (the fallback is automatic now, enforced in
  the script not just the doc). The same warn-and-continue happens on every
  later run while the token is still missing. When a token later appears,
  diarization resumes automatically (the flag is ignored once a token is
  present) — mention this so the user knows setup is all that's needed.

**Plain-text fast path** (monologue, podcast, "just summarize it"):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/speaker_transcribe.py \
  INPUT_AUDIO OUTPUT_DIR --no-diarization
```

**Remote/pre-made ASR text** (e.g. from Path B, or another ASR service): skip
the Qwen3 leg and align that text instead. `--text-file` pairs ONE transcript
with ONE input wav — passing multiple inputs is rejected (one transcript can't
be aligned to several files):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/speaker_transcribe.py \
  INPUT_AUDIO OUTPUT_DIR --text-file TRANSCRIPT.txt
```

**Non-Apple-Silicon machines:** the whisper timing leg is MLX-only. Without it
there is no timing lattice to align speakers onto — run with `--no-diarization`
and tell the user speaker mode currently requires Apple Silicon (cloud ASR with
built-in diarization, e.g. Feishu Minutes, is the no-local-GPU alternative).

**Before batching many short files** (promo clips, montage cuts — anything that
may contain music-only audio), read `## Batch Transcription (many short files)`
below: one music-only clip can stall the whole batch for 10+ minutes.

### Path B: Remote API

The remote endpoint returns plain text only — speakers are added locally by
aligning that text (leg 1) with the local timing + diarization legs. So Path B
= fetch text remotely, then run Path A's pipeline with `--text-file`.

**Health check first** (skip if already verified this session):
```bash
python3 -c "
import json, subprocess, sys
with open('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json') as f:
    cfg = json.load(f)
base = cfg['endpoint'].rsplit('/audio/', 1)[0]
noproxy = ['--noproxy', '*'] if cfg.get('noproxy', True) else []
result = subprocess.run(
    ['curl', '-s', '--max-time', '10'] + noproxy + [f'{base}/models'],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
if result.returncode != 0 or not result.stdout.strip():
    print(f'HEALTH CHECK FAILED: {base}/models', file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print(f'Service healthy: {base}')
"
```

Read config and send via curl:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, subprocess, sys, os, tempfile
with open('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json') as f:
    cfg = json.load(f)
noproxy = ['--noproxy', '*'] if cfg.get('noproxy', True) else []
timeout = str(cfg.get('max_timeout', 900))
audio_file = 'AUDIO_FILE_PATH'
output_json = tempfile.mktemp(suffix='.json', prefix='asr_')

result = subprocess.run(
    ['curl', '-s', '--max-time', timeout] + noproxy + [
        cfg['endpoint'],
        '-F', f'file=@{audio_file}',
        '-F', f'model={cfg[\"model\"]}',
        '-o', output_json
    ], capture_output=True, text=True
)

with open(output_json) as f:
    data = json.load(f)
if 'text' not in data:
    print(f'ERROR: {json.dumps(data)[:300]}', file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
text = data['text']
print(f'Transcribed: {len(text)} chars', file=sys.stderr)
print(text)
os.unlink(output_json)
" > OUTPUT.txt
```

Then attach speakers locally (Apple Silicon + pyannote token required):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/speaker_transcribe.py \
  INPUT_AUDIO OUTPUT_DIR --text-file OUTPUT.txt
```

#### Self-hosted vLLM: the limits that fail in confusing ways

**Version matters here — two of these changed between releases.** Behavior below was
measured end-to-end against vLLM `0.15.2rc1.dev68` (a dev build; there is no `0.15.2`
release — PyPI goes 0.15.1 → 0.16.0) serving `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B`, then re-read
against the `v0.26.0` sources. Check your own version first — `pip show vllm` — and
read the version notes on #1 and #3.

**1. Send OGG, not WAV — and never MP3.** MP3 is rejected outright on 0.15.x, but
the reflex fix (convert to WAV) is what walks you into the size cap in #2:

| Format | 60 s @ 16 kHz mono, 16-bit | Accepted (0.15.x) |
|---|---|---|
| WAV `pcm_s16le` | 1,920 KB | yes |
| FLAC | 1,092 KB | yes |
| **OGG Vorbis** | **245 KB** | **yes** |
| MP3 | — | **no** |

OGG is ~8× smaller than WAV at the same sample rate:

```bash
ffmpeg -nostdin -v error -i INPUT -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a libvorbis OUTPUT.ogg
```

Pin the bit depth when you compare formats yourself — decoding a lossy source
leaves ffmpeg free to widen it, and a 24-bit FLAC comes out *larger* than 16-bit
PCM, which reads as "FLAC doesn't compress" when the two simply weren't the same
recording. Add `-sample_fmt s16`.

The MP3 rejection is worth recognizing because **it arrives as HTTP 200 with an
error body** — a check that only inspects `%{http_code}` reports success:

```
HTTP=200
{"error": {"message": "Error opening <_io.BytesIO object>: Format not recognised.", ...}}
```

*Version note:* on 0.15.x the upload is read via `librosa`/soundfile on a `BytesIO`,
which refuses MP3 there even where the host's libsndfile handles MP3 on disk. `v0.26.0`
added a pyav fallback after a soundfile `LibsndfileError` (`multimodal/media/audio.py`),
so MP3/M4A likely decode on current releases — but OGG stays the better choice for the
size reason above.

**2. Requests are capped at 25 MB.**

```
{"error":{"message":"Maximum file size exceeded (parameter=audio_filesize_mb, value=28.6)",...}}
```

`VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_CLIP_FILESIZE_MB` defaults to `25` (`vllm/envs.py`, unchanged from
0.15.1 through v0.26.0). At OGG's ~245 KB/min that ceiling arrives around **100
minutes** — comfortably past a meeting, but a full-day recording or a merged
multi-segment dump will cross it. Raise it when the job is long enough to matter:

```bash
VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_CLIP_FILESIZE_MB=800 vllm serve <model> --port <port> ...
```

**3. `v0.26.0` added a second, independent limit: 10 minutes of audio.** Raising the
size cap does **not** lift it — they are separate gates, and this one rejects rather
than truncates:

```
Audio exceeds maximum allowed duration of 600s (metadata reports 5998.0s).
Set VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_DECODE_DURATION_S to increase this limit.
```

`VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_DECODE_DURATION_S` defaults to `600` and sits on the line right after
the size cap in `envs.py` — it does not exist in 0.15.x, so a lecture-length file that
works on an older server gets refused by a freshly-installed one. On `v0.26.0`+ set
both:

```bash
VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_CLIP_FILESIZE_MB=800 VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_DECODE_DURATION_S=36000 \
  vllm serve <model> --port <port> ...
```

**4. On a host that can't reach huggingface.co, model loading fails even when the
model is already cached locally.** vLLM issues a `HEAD` for `config.json` at
startup, retries five times, then exits — the error says "couldn't find them in
the cached files" even though they are right there:

```bash
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 vllm serve <model> ...
```

Same symptom, different cause worth ruling out first: a **containerized** server
has its own `HF_HOME` and cannot see the host user's `~/.cache/huggingface`, so a
model you can `ls` is genuinely absent from its view.

**5. vLLM already chunks long audio — better than a client-side splitter would.**
`SpeechToTextConfig` carries `overlap_chunk_second=1` and
`min_energy_split_window_size=1600`, i.e. it splits **at the quietest point inside
a ~100 ms window** rather than at a fixed offset, so cuts land between words. Once
the caps above are lifted, a 100-minute file goes in one request. This is why the
Step 5 fallback below is scoped to servers that *don't* do this.

**No permission to restart the server?** The caps in #2/#3 are set at server start, so
when you can't touch it, splitting client-side is what's left — that is Step 5, and on
such an endpoint it is the right tool rather than a fallback.

⚠️ **But `overlap_merge_transcribe.py` cannot drive a 0.15.x vLLM endpoint as-is**: it
cuts chunks with `-acodec copy` into `chunk_NN.mp3`, so it emits MP3 (rejected per #1)
whenever the input already is MP3, and simply *fails* on any other input — it never
checks ffmpeg's exit status, so a bad chunk surfaces later as a JSON parse error rather
than as "ffmpeg failed". The chunks also live and die inside one `TemporaryDirectory`,
so there is no point at which you could convert them. Against such an endpoint, split
manually into OGG and post each piece:

```bash
ffmpeg -nostdin -v error -i INPUT -f segment -segment_time 900 \
  -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a libvorbis chunk_%02d.ogg
```

Note this loses the overlap-merge stitching, so sentences may break at the seams —
which is exactly what the server-side energy-based splitter in #5 exists to avoid.

**If remote health check fails**, diagnose in order:

1. Network: `ping -c 1 HOST` or `tailscale status | grep HOST`
2. Service: `tailscale ssh USER@HOST "curl -s localhost:PORT/v1/models"`
3. Proxy: retry with `--noproxy '*'` toggled

**4. "Is anything actually listening?" — `ss` alone will lie to you.** It shows only
your own user's processes, so a server running as another user or **inside a container**
is invisible to it while happily serving traffic. Ask Docker in the same breath:

```bash
tailscale ssh USER@HOST "ss -ltn | grep -E ':(8000|8001|8002)'; \
  docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Status}}'"
```

**5. "Is the GPU free?"** — before starting another server, check whether one is really
holding VRAM. An **empty** compute-apps list means nothing is using it, regardless of what
an older note may claim about which service "has" the GPU:

```bash
tailscale ssh USER@HOST "nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,process_name,used_memory --format=csv"
# under WSL nvidia-smi is often off PATH: /usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi
```

**6. Restarting it? `pkill -f 'vllm serve'` kills the command that issued it.** `-f`
matches against the whole command line — and the command line you just typed contains that
exact string, so pkill matches your own shell. Symptom: the old process dies, the new one
never starts, and **nothing reports an error**. Wrap the first letter in a character class
so the pattern cannot match itself:

```bash
tailscale ssh USER@HOST "pgrep -f '[v]llm serve'"   # check
tailscale ssh USER@HOST "pkill -f '[v]llm serve'"   # kill
```

The same trap applies to any `pkill -f` whose pattern you also typed on that line.

## Step 4: Verify Output

After transcription, check for truncation — the most common failure mode:

1. Confirm output is not empty
2. Check character count is plausible (~400 chars/min for Chinese, ~200 words/min for English)
3. Check the **ending** — does it trail off mid-sentence? If so, `max_tokens` was exhausted
4. Show user the first and last ~200 characters as preview
5. **Speaker path**: check the alignment report — `anchored_ratio` should be ≥ 0.5 (the script warns when lower), the speaker count should be plausible for the recording (a two-person interview showing 5 speakers, or a monologue split into 2+, means diarization over-segmented — see `references/speaker_diarization.md` for when to distrust labels)

If truncated or wrong, use **AskUserQuestion**:
```
Transcription may be truncated:
- Expected: ~[N] chars for [M] minutes of audio
- Got: [actual] chars ([pct]% of expected)
- Last line: "[last 100 chars...]"

Options:
A) Retry with higher max_tokens (current: [N], try: [N*2])
B) Switch mode — try [local/remote] instead
C) Save as-is — the output looks complete to me
D) Abort
```

## Step 5: Fallback — Overlap-Merge (Remote API Only)

**Check whether your server chunks internally before reaching for this.** vLLM does
(Path B limit #5), and its energy-based split beats this script's fixed-offset one — so
on a vLLM endpoint you control, a too-long file is fixed by lifting the caps rather than
by splitting client-side.

Chunk client-side when the endpoint **can't take the whole file**: it rejects long audio
outright (fixed context window, hard per-request duration limit), it OOMs at the same
input length every time, or it does chunk internally but you have no permission to raise
its caps.

**A timeout is a different failure and usually has a cheaper fix** — the request was
accepted and was still running. Raise `max_timeout` in the config first (a 100-minute
file at ~60× realtime still needs a couple of minutes, and the default can be tighter
than that); reach for chunking only if it times out with a generous ceiling, which
means the server is genuinely too slow for one pass.

When one of those applies, fall back to chunked transcription:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/overlap_merge_transcribe.py \
  --config "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json" \
  INPUT_AUDIO OUTPUT.txt
```

Splits into 18-minute chunks with 2-minute overlap, merges using punctuation-stripped fuzzy matching. See `references/overlap_merge_strategy.md` for algorithm details.

For local MLX mode, overlap-merge is unnecessary — the bundled script handles chunking internally with `max_tokens=200000`.

## Step 6: Recommend Transcript Correction

ASR output always contains recognition errors — homophones, garbled technical terms, broken sentences. After successful transcription, **proactively suggest** running the `transcript-fixer` skill on the output:

```
Transcription complete: [N] chars saved to [output_path].

ASR output typically contains recognition errors (homophones, garbled terms, broken sentences).
Would you like me to run /daymade-audio:transcript-fixer to clean up the text?

Options:
A) Yes — run daymade-audio:transcript-fixer on the output now (Recommended)
B) No — the raw transcription is good enough for my needs
C) Later — I'll run it myself when ready
```

If the user chooses A, invoke the `transcript-fixer` skill with the output file path. The two skills form a natural pipeline: **transcribe → correct → review**.

## Reconfigure

```bash
rm "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json"
```

Then re-run Step 0.

## Batch Transcription (many short files)

Passing many files to one `transcribe_local_mlx.py` invocation is efficient (model loads once) — **but only when every file contains actual speech.** If the batch may include music-only / BGM-only clips (short promo videos, montage clips with subtitles instead of voiceover), do NOT batch them in one process:

- On music/rhythm-only audio the model can fall into a **repetition loop hallucination** (e.g. endless "One, two, three, one, two, three...") that burns toward `max_tokens=200000` — one such file can stall for 10+ minutes and starve the whole batch.
- **Drive batch jobs one-file-per-process with a per-file timeout** (e.g. `timeout 240` / `perl -e 'alarm 240; exec @ARGV'` around each invocation, skip on timeout, second pass for failures). A stuck file then costs 4 minutes, not the batch.
- For a stuck file, retry with `--max-tokens 3000`: real speech in a short clip fits comfortably; a looping file gets truncated output you can classify.
- **Detect "no speech" instead of shipping garbage**: if the transcript's unique-word ratio is extremely low (e.g. `len(set(words))/len(words) < 0.06` on a 40+ char output), the clip almost certainly has no voiceover — label it as such rather than delivering the loop text. (Downstream OCR of on-screen captions is the actual fix for subtitle-only videos.)

## Word-Level Timestamps (subtitles, audio-visual alignment)

mlx-whisper's word timing is now the **timing leg of the default speaker pipeline** (leg 2 — `scripts/word_timestamps_whisper.py` runs it automatically). This section is for using word timestamps STANDALONE: subtitle generation, aligning narration to shot boundaries, per-clip captioning.

Qwen3-ASR is an LLM-decoder ASR: it emits plain text with no alignment information, on both local and remote paths. When the task needs to know *when* each word is spoken, use `mlx-whisper` with `word_timestamps=True`. Whisper's cross-attention word alignment is the de-facto local solution for this class of task.

Key facts (full recipe in `references/whisper_word_timestamps.md`):

- Model: `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` (~1.6GB). Its Chinese WER is higher than Qwen3-ASR for pure transcription, but for alignment tasks Qwen3-ASR is not an option at all; prime domain terms via `initial_prompt`.
- **Segment granularity trap**: on short videos (15–40s) whisper often returns the whole clip as one segment — always work from the word list and assign words to time windows by midpoint.
- Pairs with ffmpeg scene detection (`select='gt(scene,0.3)'`) for the visual side; avoid PySceneDetect on non-ASCII paths.

## Speaker Diarization & Identification (who said what)

Speaker labels are the DEFAULT output of Step 3 (decoupled architecture:
full-audio Qwen3-ASR text + whisper timing lattice + pyannote segments,
aligned — never cut-then-transcribe). This section covers the pieces.

- **The pipeline** — `scripts/speaker_transcribe.py` runs all three legs +
  alignment in one command and writes the speaker-labeled transcript + CSV.
  Architecture, alignment algorithm, trust signals (`anchored_ratio`), and
  failure modes: `references/decoupled_speaker_alignment.md`. Production
  pitfalls (over-segmentation, mic-domain effects, when to distrust labels):
  `references/speaker_diarization.md`.
- **Diarization alone** — `scripts/diarize_speakers.py` emits just the
  `speaker × time` segments (no transcription).
- **Legacy cascade** — `scripts/speaker_transcribe_cascade.py` is the old
  cut-then-transcribe variant (diarize → slice audio per turn → ASR each
  slice). It breaks ASR context at every cut and lowers text quality; kept
  only for extremely noisy / heavy-overlap audio where per-slice isolation of
  a dominant near-field speaker beats full-audio ASR. Everything else uses
  the decoupled default.
- **Voiceprint identification** — diarization labels are anonymous
  (`SPEAKER_00`…) and per-file. To map them to real names, unify a speaker
  across files, or collapse diarization's over-segmentation, use CAM++
  voiceprints via `scripts/voiceprint_id.py`. Recipe **and the critical
  acoustic-domain caveat** — a voiceprint built from one mic type matches the
  same person on a different mic far less well:
  `references/voiceprint_speaker_id.md`.

**One-time pyannote setup** (gated model): accept terms at
`hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`, then `huggingface-cli login` once
(or set `HF_TOKEN`). Auto-detected on every run afterward.

## Transcript Audit & Review (HTML)

After diarization you get a CSV per file (`file,start,end,duration,speaker,text`). The bundled audit HTML generator turns those CSVs into a single, reader-first review page with audio playback, per-turn flags/notes, speaker aliasing, and export.

Generate it from a speaker-transcribe output directory:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/generate_audit_html.py \
  OUTPUT_DIR \
  --output OUTPUT_DIR/audit/index.html \
  --audio-dir /path/to/original/audio
```

Defaults assume a flat layout under `PROJECT_DIR`: `PROJECT_DIR/*.csv` transcripts, `PROJECT_DIR/*.diarization.json`, and the original audio files placed next to the outputs. `speaker_transcribe.py` itself writes the CSV, TXT, and diarization files flat under its `OUTPUT_DIR`. If your project uses a different structure, override any of those paths:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/generate_audit_html.py \
  /path/to/project \
  --output /path/to/project/audit/index.html \
  --csv-dir /path/to/project/csv \
  --txt-dir /path/to/project/txt \
  --diarization-dir /path/to/project/diarization \
  --audio-dir /path/to/project/audio \
  --original-dir /path/to/project/original \
  --manifest /path/to/project/manifest.json \
  --title "Project Audit" \
  --subtitle "Speaker-labeled transcript review" \
  --storage-key "project-audit" \
  --known-speaker "Speaker A" \
  --known-speaker "Speaker B"
```

**Key CLI options:**

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `project_dir` | Base project directory (required) |
| `--output` | Where to write `index.html` |
| `--csv-dir` | Directory containing `*.csv` transcript files |
| `--txt-dir` | Directory containing `*.txt` plain-text transcripts (optional) |
| `--diarization-dir` | Directory containing `*.diarization.json` files |
| `--audio-dir` | Directory containing playback audio files |
| `--original-dir` | Directory containing original source media (optional) |
| `--manifest` | JSON manifest mapping file IDs to metadata (optional) |
| `--title` / `--subtitle` | Page title and subtitle |
| `--storage-key` | `localStorage` namespace for state persistence |
| `--known-speaker` | Repeatable; `"Name"` auto-assigns a color, `"Name=#hex"` sets one explicitly |
| `--material-final` / `--material-rough` | Repeatable material classification labels used for filtering |

The output is a single self-contained HTML file with no external dependencies. Open it in a browser to review, flag, and annotate turns; the export button produces a report of all flagged rows with reasons and notes.

## Troubleshooting

### Local MLX fails while loading the model

If model loading fails with an error like:

```text
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '__module__'
```

the agent is probably using an unpinned or stale copy of the local MLX script. The known-good stack is:

```text
mlx-audio 0.3.1
mlx-lm 0.30.5
transformers 5.0.0rc3
```

Run the bundled `--smoke-test` command and confirm the dependency stack line matches. Do not start a long transcription until the smoke test succeeds.

### A self-hosted remote endpoint rejects the audio

Each of these points away from its real cause, which is why they are worth
recognizing by symptom. Full detail and fixes: Path B's "Self-hosted vLLM: the
limits that fail in confusing ways" section.

| Symptom | Actual cause |
|---|---|
| `Maximum file size exceeded (parameter=audio_filesize_mb, ...)` | 25 MB cap, counted in **bytes not minutes** — converting to WAV is usually what crossed it; send OGG (~8× smaller) |
| `HTTP 200` but the body is `{"error": ... "Format not recognised."}` | MP3 sent to a 0.15.x server — and a status-code-only check calls this success |
| `Audio exceeds maximum allowed duration of 600s` | A **second, independent** cap added in `v0.26.0`; raising the size cap does not lift it → `VLLM_MAX_AUDIO_DECODE_DURATION_S` |
| Server won't start: "couldn't find them in the cached files" while the model *is* cached | Startup tried to reach huggingface.co → `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`; if containerized, its `HF_HOME` may simply not see the host's cache |
| Long file fails, and you are about to chunk it client-side | vLLM already splits at low-energy points — lift the caps instead, unless you can't restart the server (Step 5 explains when chunking *is* right) |

### `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is not substituted

Script paths in this skill use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` — the skill's own directory, which Claude Code substitutes when the skill loads. If a command reaches you with the literal `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (some runtimes don't substitute), resolve the skill directory in this order:

1. The skill-load envelope: `Base directory for this skill: <path>` → `<path>` is the skill directory.
2. No envelope → find candidates and pick the one this session's available-skills list points to (installed copies can lag a source checkout):
   `find ~/.claude ~/.claude-profiles ~/.codex ~/workspace -maxdepth 7 -type d -name asr-transcribe-to-text 2>/dev/null | head -5`

Substitute the resolved absolute path for `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` everywhere in this document.
