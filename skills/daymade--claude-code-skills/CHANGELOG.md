## [Unreleased]

## [1.48.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **daymade-claude-code** suite v1.0.0: Claude Code operations suite bundling 7 power-user skills (`claude-code-history-files-finder`, `continue-claude-work`, `claude-skills-troubleshooting`, `claude-md-progressive-disclosurer`, `statusline-generator`, `claude-export-txt-better`, `marketplace-dev`) under one shared namespace. One command gets the full Claude Code toolkit and invocations render as `daymade-claude-code:<skill>` instead of the redundant `<skill>:<skill>` form.

### Changed
- **Canonical source migration**: The 7 Claude Code-related skills were physically moved from the repo root into `suites/daymade-claude-code/<skill>/`, mirroring the `daymade-docs` suite pattern. Both the suite and the 7 individual single-skill plugins now install from the same canonical location, keeping plugin caches narrow (only the suite's own files, not the whole repo). Transparent to existing users: plugin names and invocation remain identical; `claude plugin update` fetches from the new path automatically.
- Patch bumps for the 7 migrated skills to reflect the manifest/source change:
  - `claude-code-history-files-finder` 1.0.2 → 1.0.3
  - `continue-claude-work` 1.1.1 → 1.1.2
  - `claude-skills-troubleshooting` 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
  - `claude-md-progressive-disclosurer` 1.2.0 → 1.2.1
  - `statusline-generator` 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
  - `claude-export-txt-better` 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
  - `marketplace-dev` 1.2.0 → 1.2.1 (also simplified hook paths from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/marketplace-dev/hooks/...` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/...` now that the cache root is the skill dir itself)
- Updated marketplace version from 1.47.0 to 1.48.0
- Updated marketplace plugin entries from 51 to 52
- README / README.zh-CN / CLAUDE.md / references/new-skill-guide.md: all doc links to these 7 skills now point to `suites/daymade-claude-code/<skill>/`

## [1.47.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **wechat-article-scraper** v2.9.0: World-class WeChat article extraction with 6-level strategy routing (fast→adaptive→stable→reliable→zero_dep→jina_ai), OG metadata fallback, image-paragraph association, lazy loading handling, local image download, and Sogou search discovery. Supports Markdown/JSON/HTML/PDF export. Includes 15 unique/leading features surpassing all competitors.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace skills count from 47 to 48
- Updated marketplace version from 1.46.0 to 1.47.0

### Added
- **gangtise-copilot** v1.0.0: One-stop installer and companion for the full Gangtise (岗底斯投研) OpenAPI skill suite — 19 official skills covering data retrieval (OHLC 行情, 财务, 估值, 研报, 首席观点, 会议纪要, 调研纪要), research workflows (个股研究 L1-L4, 观点 PK 对抗性分析, 主题研究, 事件复盘, 公告摘要), and utility (股票池管理, 公开网页搜索). Distilled from a 5-round discovery session that reverse-engineered the complete Gangtise skill catalog — the Gangtise OBS bucket has LIST permission disabled, so the full 19-skill inventory is not discoverable from any public manifest. Ships with 4 preset install modes (full / workshop / minimal / custom), zero-config multi-agent distribution to Claude Code / OpenClaw / Codex via symlink from a single canonical install location, shared XDG credential file at `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` that rotates all 19 skills in one edit, and a read-only diagnostic script with scoped liveness checks (`auth` scope + `rag` scope). Ships: `scripts/install_gangtise.sh` (408 lines), `scripts/configure_auth.sh` (310 lines), `scripts/diagnose.sh` (320 lines), and 5 reference docs covering installation flow, credentials setup, the complete 19-skill registry with per-script capability matrix, known ecosystem traps (parallel product lines, bundle-only hidden skills, double-Bearer token bug, admin endpoint 1009 errors), and workshop best practices. Target use case: the 2026 Q2 investor Workshop series where students need to install a large skill suite quickly without reverse-engineering the catalog themselves.

### Changed
- **Renamed**: `markdown-tools` → `doc-to-markdown` — clearer name for DOCX/PDF/PPTX → Markdown conversion
- **doc-to-markdown**: Added 8 DOCX post-processing fixes (grid tables, simple tables, CJK bold spacing, JSON pretty-print, image path flattening, pandoc attribute cleanup, code block detection, bracket fixes)
- **doc-to-markdown**: Added 31 unit tests (`test_convert.py`)
- **doc-to-markdown**: Added 5-tool benchmark report (`references/benchmark-2026-03-22.md`)
- **marketplace-dev** v1.0.0 → v1.1.0: Added evidence intake from Claude Code history, plugin boundary decision guidance, source/cache patterns for single-skill and suite plugins, source+skills resolution validation, and cache footprint testing based on real marketplace debugging sessions.
- **marketplace-dev** v1.1.0 → v1.2.0: Refined against Anthropic's official skill-authoring best practices. Extracted the inline Node.js resolution check and diff pipeline into `scripts/check_marketplace.sh` — a one-shot validator that runs JSON syntax → `claude plugin validate` → source+skills resolution → reverse sync (disk SKILL.md → manifest) in a single command. Moved the two PostToolUse hook scripts from `scripts/` to `hooks/` for semantic clarity (scripts execute during skill workflow, hooks guard the editor) and updated the plugin manifest's hook paths accordingly. Added tables of contents to `anti_patterns.md` and `cache_and_source_patterns.md` (both >100 lines, per best practices). Corrected Phase 0 subagent history-mining paths to `<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`. Documented the auto-activated hook behaviour in a new "Bundled hooks" section.

## [1.46.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **claude-export-txt-better** v1.0.0: Fixes broken line wrapping in Claude Code exported `.txt` conversation files. Reconstructs tables, paragraphs, paths, and tool calls that were hard-wrapped at fixed column widths. Ships with an automated validation suite of 53 generic, file-agnostic checks. Triggers on export files with broken formatting or when the user mentions "fix export" / "fix conversation" / references a `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-*.txt` file. Bundled: `scripts/fix-claude-export.py`, `scripts/validate-claude-export-fix.py`, `evals/`.
- **douban-skill** v1.0.0: Exports and syncs Douban (豆瓣) book / movie / music / game collections to local CSV files via the reverse-engineered Frodo API. Supports full export and RSS incremental sync. No login, no cookies, no browser. Pre-flight user-ID validation and CSV output with UTF-8 BOM (Excel-compatible). Ships with a complete troubleshooting log of 7 tested scraping approaches and why each failed. Bundled: `scripts/douban-frodo-export.py`, `scripts/douban-rss-sync.py`, `references/troubleshooting.md`, `.gitleaks.toml` (allowlisting the public APK credentials).
- **terraform-skill** v1.0.0: Operational traps for Terraform provisioners, multi-environment isolation, and zero-to-deployment reliability. Every failure pattern documented caused a real incident. Covers provisioner timing races, SSH connection conflicts, DNS record duplication, volume permissions, database bootstrap gaps, snapshot cross-contamination, Cloudflare credential format errors, hardcoded domains in Caddyfiles/compose, and init-data-only-on-first-boot pitfalls. Organised as *exact error → root cause → copy-paste fix*. Bundled: `references/` with detailed remediation patterns.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace skills count from 44 to 47
- Updated marketplace version from 1.45.1 to 1.46.0
- Updated marketplace plugin entries from 47 to 50
- Updated README.md badges and skill listings (English and Chinese)
- Updated CLAUDE.md skill count (44 → 47) and plugin entry count (47 → 50)

## [1.45.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **daymade-docs** v1.0.0 → v1.0.1: Narrowed the suite plugin source to `suites/daymade-docs/` so the installed cache contains only the documentation skills in the suite instead of a full repository snapshot.
- Moved the daymade-docs member skills under `suites/daymade-docs/` as their canonical source and repointed the corresponding single-skill plugin entries to those same directories.
- **doc-to-markdown** v2.1.0 → v2.1.1, **mermaid-tools** v1.0.1 → v1.0.2, **ppt-creator** v1.0.0 → v1.0.1, **pdf-creator** v1.3.1 → v1.3.2, **docs-cleaner** v1.0.0 → v1.0.1, and **meeting-minutes-taker** v1.1.0 → v1.1.1 now install from their suite canonical source paths.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace version from 1.45.0 to 1.45.1

## [1.45.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **daymade-docs** v1.0.0: Documentation suite plugin that exposes `doc-to-markdown`, `mermaid-tools`, `pdf-creator`, `ppt-creator`, `docs-cleaner`, and `meeting-minutes-taker` under one namespace. This keeps the existing single-skill plugins available while providing `/daymade-docs:<skill-name>` slash commands for users who want a combined documentation workflow install.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace version from 1.44.0 to 1.45.0
- Updated README.md, README.zh-CN.md, and CLAUDE.md to document suite plugin architecture while preserving the existing single-skill plugin model.

## [1.44.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **skill-creator** v1.7.1 → v1.7.2: Completeness pass for the `workflows/wrapper-skill/` methodology within its scope (zip-archive skill packages distributed via `npx skills add`). A fifth adversarial agent review audited the wrapper-skill workflow docs against the canonical `ima-copilot` implementation and surfaced 13 on-scope lessons that were implicit in the reference code but not elevated to named patterns in the workflow. This release lands all 13.
  - `patterns.md` install template: replaced the `<download and extract>` placeholder with a concrete defensive block covering `curl --fail` with HTTP-code branching, `wc -c` download-size sanity check rejecting suspiciously small archives before extraction, Node.js ≥18 numeric check (separate from `command -v node`), and a documented zero-agents-detected fallback policy (abort vs silent-skip vs default-to-claude-code, with the session's chosen answer named). Every defensive pattern has an accompanying "Lessons baked into this template" bullet explaining *why* it's there.
  - `patterns.md` known_issues template: added `**Why upstream probably hasn't fixed it**` as a required field (the field that keeps repair blocks load-bearing across upstream upgrades), added `Strategy skip` as a first-class documented third option (users on tolerant platforms may legitimately not want the repair and naming the skip path explicit prevents the "did I forget?" failure mode), and added detailed notes on the `[ -f ... ] && \` guard rationale, `sed -i.bak ... && command rm -f *.bak` BSD/GNU portability dance, and backup directory naming convention.
  - `patterns.md` diagnose template: added a new "Detection function return-code contract" subsection spelling out the required return codes for every post-repair state (untouched-good, untouched-broken, not-present, each Strategy-applied state, and the dual-state conflicted code). The dual-state code is the single hardest lesson from the ima-copilot session — a detection function that doesn't recognize it silently passes conflicted installs as healthy.
  - `patterns.md` diagnose template: added variadic `find_install` rationale explaining that agents whose home-directory layout has not stabilized (like OpenClaw) should be probed against an ordered list of candidate paths, and that designing the helper as variadic from day one avoids a painful refactor when a second candidate path becomes necessary.
  - `patterns.md` SKILL.md template: added explicit checklist for the description field (literal error strings from the session, tool name in every language the session used, self-disambiguation clause naming the upstream package to prevent wrapper-vs-upstream trigger fighting, symptoms that triggered the original session), plus a reference to the enforced 1024-character cap in `quick_validate.py:184`. Added "when in doubt → diagnose" as a recommended routing table default since diagnose is the only read-only entry point.
  - `patterns.md` credentials section: added explicit guidance that liveness checks must match on **response-body shape**, not just HTTP status. Many APIs return 200 OK with an error JSON body, and a naive `curl --fail` check will pass a credential that fails the first real operation.
  - `workflow.md` Step 5: expanded the install-script bullet list with prerequisite-check discipline (curl/unzip/npx loop plus separate Node.js ≥18 parse), download integrity defense in depth (HTTP code branching + size sanity), and the zero-agents fallback policy.
  - `workflow.md` Step 6: expanded the known_issues schema to include the `Why upstream probably hasn't fixed it` field and the `Strategy skip` branch, and documented the `sed -i.bak` cross-BSD/GNU portability rule alongside the existing `command cp/mv` guidance.
  - `workflow.md` Step 7: replaced the "returns OK / TRIGGERED / N/A / post-fix-state" shorthand with an explicit enumeration of the return-code contract, and added the variadic `find_install` guidance for agents with unstabilized layouts.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace version from 1.43.0 to 1.44.0

## [1.43.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **ima-copilot** v1.0.0 → v1.0.1: Contract compliance and dogfood-driven fixes
  - `SKILL.md`, `references/known_issues.md`, `references/installation_flow.md`: removed hardcoded references to upstream version `1.1.2`. Install script keeps the version as an overridable default which is explicitly allowed by the architecture contract. Fixes a principle 6 (independent evolution) violation that would have forced a skill version bump on every upstream release.
  - `references/known_issues.md`: added `command` prefix to the `sed -i.bak` and `rm -f` commands in Strategy A repair block and to the `rm -f` command in Strategy A rollback, matching the contract's alias-safe requirement. Previously, a user shell with `alias rm='rm -i'` or `alias sed='sed -i'` would hang the repair on an interactive prompt.
  - `scripts/install_ima_skill.sh`: added a Node.js ≥18 preflight check. The `npx skills add` distribution path needs a modern Node runtime and the failure message on old Node is opaque.
  - `scripts/diagnose.sh`: `check_submodule` now recognizes and explicitly warns on the dual-state where both `SKILL.md` and `MODULE.md` exist simultaneously (can happen when a user switched repair strategies mid-session or restored a partial backup). Previously this reported clean while the install was in a conflicted state.
  - `scripts/search_fanout.py`: `rank_groups` now sorts tied hit counts by KB name for deterministic byte-identical output. Previously the tie-break depended on `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.map` completion order, which varied with network timing.
- **skill-creator** v1.7.0 → v1.7.1: Wrapper-skill workflow hardening from counter-review findings
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/workflow.md` Step 2: added a "How to access the conversation" subsection with concrete guidance for three cases (same session / follow-up session / neither available) and an explicit "do not fabricate content" rule for the last case. Fresh agents were previously left to guess.
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/workflow.md` Step 1: added an "AskUserQuestion fallback" subsection explaining that the consent requirement is the explicit user choice, not the specific tool name, and showing a plain-text fallback pattern for harnesses without `AskUserQuestion`.
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/patterns.md`: added a new "Runtime-logic patterns shared across wrappers" section with three generalizable insights distilled from ima-copilot's `search_fanout.py` — **capability partitioning** (enumerate vs operate permission asymmetry with four-way result bucketing), **undocumented limit detection** (silent truncation heuristics for APIs that cap results without emitting pagination tokens), and **scoped liveness checks** (probe the lowest-privilege operation the skill actually performs, not the easiest API call). Each pattern includes example code, real-world examples across multiple APIs (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Google Drive), and a cross-reference to the ima-copilot implementation.
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/verification_protocol.md`: restructured into Track 1 (session cross-reference for literal transcriptions) and Track 2 (smoke test / unit test for runtime logic). The previous "verification is not dogfood" dogma was too strict — it correctly applied to Track 1 files but wrongly exempted Track 2 runtime code from end-to-end testing. Track 2 files like `search_fanout.py` now have an explicit mandatory-smoke-test rule.

### Changed
- Updated marketplace version from 1.42.0 to 1.43.0

## [1.42.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **skill-creator** v1.6.0 → v1.7.0: New `workflows/wrapper-skill/` specialized workflow for retrospectively distilling an install-and-debug session into a reusable companion skill for a third-party CLI tool
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/workflow.md` — the retrospective distillation workflow with Step 2 conversation mining at its core (install flow, credential setup, bugs encountered and resolved, design decisions made, noise to discard)
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/architecture_contract.md` — seven non-negotiable principles that every generated wrapper skill must follow (never vendor upstream, runtime repair over ship-time patches, explicit user consent for any upstream file modification, idempotent/reversible/alias-safe repair commands, teaching agents over humans, independent evolution from upstream, private preferences stay private)
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/patterns.md` — copy-pasteable templates for SKILL.md, install script, diagnose script, known_issues registry, and credential setup, each annotated with the lessons baked in and cross-referenced to the canonical ima-copilot implementation
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/verification_protocol.md` — post-generation verification focused on cross-referencing generated artifacts against the source conversation rather than re-running the full install (the install already ran in the source session)
  - `workflows/wrapper-skill/scripts/init_wrapper_skill.py` — bootstrap scaffold that creates the wrapper skill directory layout with placeholder markers pointing back at specific steps in the workflow
  - `SKILL.md` root entry now includes a "Specialized Workflow: Wrapper Skills for Third-Party CLI Tools" routing section between Capture Intent and Prior Art Research that redirects agents to the wrapper workflow when the signals apply
  - Canonical reference implementation: [`ima-copilot`](./ima-copilot) — the Tencent IMA wrapper that was the first product of this methodology, distilled during a real session whose lessons (shell alias bypass, root SKILL.md detection, realpath-based symlink dedup, idempotent reversible repairs) were captured in the patterns and propagated into this workflow

### Changed
- Updated marketplace version from 1.41.0 to 1.42.0

## [1.41.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **New Skill**: ima-copilot v1.0.0 — One-stop companion and installer for the official Tencent IMA skill (ima.qq.com), with wrapper-layer architecture that never vendors upstream files
  - Zero-config installation to Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw via `npx skills add` ([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) with auto-detection of installed agents and default symlink mode, so that a repair or upgrade applied once propagates automatically to every agent that shares the canonical install
  - XDG-style credential management at `~/.config/ima/{client_id, api_key}` with env-var fallback (`IMA_OPENAPI_CLIENTID` / `IMA_OPENAPI_APIKEY`)
  - Bundled `scripts/diagnose.sh` for read-only health check covering install presence, credential liveness, and known upstream issues with structured `✅/⚠️/❌` report
  - Bundled `scripts/install_ima_skill.sh` with version override via `--version` flag or `IMA_VERSION` env var
  - Bundled `scripts/search_fanout.py` for client-side cross-knowledge-base search with priority-based KB boosting, skip-list filtering, 100-result silent-truncation detection, and permission-denied KB partitioning (typical for subscribed KBs)
  - Detects and repairs ISSUE-001 (submodule SKILL.md files missing YAML frontmatter in upstream v1.1.2) with two user-selectable strategies: Strategy A (rename to `MODULE.md` and patch root references — respects upstream design intent) or Strategy B (prepend minimal frontmatter — smallest diff)
  - All repair commands are idempotent, reversible (with automatic timestamped backups to `/tmp/ima-copilot-backups/`), and use `command cp`/`command mv` to bypass interactive shell aliases
  - Personalization via `~/.config/ima/copilot.json` with `priority_kbs` and `skip_kbs` lists — template at `config-template/copilot.json.example` uses illustrative-only values so the skill ships with zero real KB names
  - Comprehensive reference documentation in `references/` covering installation flow, API key setup, known issues (source of truth for repairs), and search best practices
  - Never vendors, forks, or mirrors upstream files — every repair is a runtime instruction executed with explicit user consent
