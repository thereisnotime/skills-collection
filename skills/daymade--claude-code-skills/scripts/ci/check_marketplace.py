"""Check .claude-plugin/marketplace.json against the repository on disk.

This is the manifest every user's `/plugin marketplace add` reads. A plugin whose
`source` no longer resolves, or a duplicated name, breaks installation for everyone
pulling the marketplace — and nothing else in the repo notices, because no skill
imports this file.

Only assertions that hold on `main` today are enforced, so a red result always means
"this pull request broke something", never "this repo has always been like that".
Deliberately NOT enforced: a length cap on marketplace descriptions. The 1024-character
limit belongs to SKILL.md frontmatter (quick_validate checks it there); no such limit is
documented for this file, and one entry already exceeds it. Guessing a constraint and
gating on it would fail honest pull requests for a rule nobody agreed to.

Both directions are checked: every declared entry must resolve on disk, AND every
plugin-looking directory on disk must be declared. The second direction is the one that
fails silently otherwise — a skill committed without a marketplace entry simply never
becomes installable, and no other check notices (2026-07-21: seven skills sat
unregistered, one for four months).
