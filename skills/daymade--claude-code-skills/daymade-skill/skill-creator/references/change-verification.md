# Choose verification by the actual change

Fix required acceptance and read the verification-depth section before choosing a workflow. Read the heavy-eval gate only when planning that evidence or multiple execution units; classification does not authorize it. Return to the selected authoring or specialized workflow once the evidence plan is fixed. Re-enter when a concrete delta or contradictory evidence changes the plan.

## Fix required acceptance before selecting evidence

Before selecting a tier or tuning an existing Skill, fix the original user's
required result in the existing task plan or outcome worksheet. Name the important
affected jobs, their output-level acceptance criteria and the observations needed
to decide each criterion. Include required functionality or performance
preservation when the user requested it; distinguish those observations from
optional benefit claims. For an existing Skill, use the frozen old bundle to identify affected branches,
interfaces, failure/recovery cases and loading routes. Do not derive acceptance
only from the examples the candidate already passes.

Keep two completion gates separate:

- **Static preservation:** clear the current
  [migration review](existing-skill-migration.md#existing-skill-migration-gate),
  including every unmatched old unit and its semantic disposition.
- **Required task results:** obtain the named output and performance evidence
  against the original acceptance. Static audit, validation, CI and review success
  do not establish these results by themselves. Use a direct authority or
  deterministic check when it decides a narrow correction; use actual task
  outputs and appropriate old/new observations when it does not.

Select 1–2 replays only when they exercise the entire changed behavior **and**
required preservation scope. For a broad loading or routing change, cover each
important affected job rather than treating a successful correction, recovery or
creation example as evidence for all jobs. Choose further evidence by the remaining
failure axes; this does not impose repeated trials or multi-model benchmarks on
every edit. Keep the tier and heavy-eval authorization boundaries below.

Execute this acceptance check as the task owner, with the independent evidence
required by the selected tier. The audit CLI cannot decide whether the plan covers
the user's intent or whether the task outputs meet it. Keep a required criterion
unresolved when its observations are missing; a limitation statement does not waive
it. Continue available authorized work, or report the unmet criterion and exact
authorization/environment needed to resume. Treat only a later user instruction
as a scope change. Finish after both gates clear; omit optional unmeasured claims
without adding work that cannot change the acceptance decision.

## Verification depth router (run before choosing any workflow)

Choose the **lowest tier that can falsify the changed behavior** before taking a generic or specialized workflow branch. Classify by the concrete delta and its failure surface, not line count or request vocabulary: one changed destructive command can outrank a long prose cleanup, while a request to "optimize" an existing skill may still be one bounded correction. Before selecting a tier, list the rules, contracts, scripts, permissions, and outputs you actually intend to change. If that list is not known yet, inspect first and keep the classification provisional; uncertainty about scope is not evidence for Tier 3.

| Tier | Use when | Required evidence | Do not add by default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Targeted** | This is an existing skill; no capability, trigger family, workflow branch, output contract, dependency, permission, or external-write behavior is added or materially changed; and the edit is exactly one of: (a) spelling/format-only with no behavior change, (b) a factual doc/config correction whose truth a direct authority decides, or (c) a bounded implementation repair that restores an explicit existing contract **and** whose repaired behavior a deterministic regression check covers. A clarification that can change agent behavior is not Tier 1. **Adding or materially rewriting `references/` content is not Tier 1 either, even when the SKILL.md diff is one line**: it changes the runtime loading surface — what an executing agent is told to open, and when — which is exactly the axis the deterministic gates cannot see (they check that references are *reachable*, never that their pointers are *acted on*). Start it at Tier 2, and escalate to Tier 3 when the change itself hits a Tier-3 trigger (it is a methodology expansion, or spans 3+ prompt classes). Tier 2's evidence for this shape: 1–2 with-skill replays whose acceptance criteria are **output-level** (did the new content shape the output — a literal "was the file opened" assertion is the literal-tool-path failure mode this skill's own guidance forbids); where the reference-load ledger hook is installed, its record of whether the file was opened is mechanical corroboration, not the criterion | For all three: run `quick_validate`, inspect the diff, and complete the existing-skill migration gate. Then use the matching evidence only: (a) exact readback/format check; (b) authoritative fact plus its narrow check; (c) explicit existing contract plus deterministic regression. Add discipline #5's one fresh reviewer only when its rule/contract/number threshold is crossed | Agent behavior replays, paired runs, baselines, graders, benchmark, viewer, eval files |
| **2 — Sampled behavior** | This is an existing skill; the change affects agent behavior but adds no capability, trigger family, output contract, script behavior, dependency, permission, or external write; and 1–2 named examples with explicit acceptance criteria can exercise the whole changed behavior. A bounded correction to one existing routing or evidence-selection rule stays here even when it changes the chosen path | Run only those 1–2 representative with-skill replays plus the narrow deterministic checks and the one fresh-context review required by discipline #5 | Baselines, paired fan-out, variance analysis, benchmark, viewer, or eval files by default. An explicit request for them goes through the separate evidence-budget gate and does not reclassify the change |
| **3 — Broad / high-risk** | Any of these is true: any new skill; any new or materially changed capability; broad cross-branch rewrite or methodology expansion; trigger/description optimization (running the optimizer loop, or adding or removing trigger families — shortening a description under the frontmatter rule with every old clause cited by the regression gate is not this); a new workflow branch or materially changed output contract, script capability, dependency, or permission; high-risk automation or external writes; or the changed behavior itself spans 3+ distinct prompt classes, repeated trials, or materially different approaches | Run deterministic gates first, then add only the evidence needed for the named failure axes. The full paired pipeline below is available only after the separate heavy-eval authorization gate passes; Tier 3 by itself does not start it, and the same gate can authorize extra evidence at another tier | Automatic paired fan-out, graders, benchmark, or viewer based only on the Tier 3 label |

For changes to persisted formats or partial state updates, permission-sensitive
checks, and commands whose output may exceed the tool response, load
[stateful-script-verification.md](stateful-script-verification.md).
Select its affected recipes as narrow deterministic evidence within the chosen tier.
For a provider, default route or enable-switch change, use its
**Operational route changes** recipe: preserve the original user result and
exercise the actual downstream consumer, including asynchronous/device removal
and human-review exits. A reachable pointer alone does not prove the handoff runs.

For an operational Skill whose changed workflow needs installation, account
configuration, a live service or human cooperation, read
[first use and recovery](first-use-and-resume.md) before drafting that
workflow. Put automatic preparation and continuation in the ordinary entry,
reuse existing execution owners, and test the affected missing-state, valid-state
and interrupted-state paths against the original task. A written setup guide,
healthy process or loaded model alone does not establish first-use success.
Skip this route for reference-only Skills and self-sufficient file transforms.

## Heavy-eval authorization gate — separate from tier classification

A tier describes **risk and uncertainty**; it does not authorize token spend or agent fan-out. Passing this gate changes the permitted evidence plan, not the tier. The generic paired baseline → grader → benchmark → viewer pipeline may run only when either:

- the user explicitly asks for A/B, baselines, benchmarking, repeated trials, a viewer, or multi-agent evaluation; or
- the executor can name at least three distinct prompt classes, competing plausible outcomes, and the decision that paired comparison would change, then obtains the user's explicit opt-in.

For an existing-skill optimization, default to zero eval agents: run deterministic
checks first, then one or two with-skill replays only when they cover the entire
changed behavior and required preservation scope. If they cannot, select evidence
for the remaining required criteria under the gate above rather than narrowing
acceptance to fit the sample. Discipline #5's one fresh-context reviewer is a release
gate, not permission to create a reviewer team. A token/cost-sensitivity instruction
blocks the heavy pipeline until the user explicitly reverses it.

Before spawning more than one research, mining, eval, or grading agent, separate **roles** from **execution units**:

- Each additional role or reviewer must own a distinct failure axis or output. Template availability never justifies another role.
- Necessary experimental arms and corpus shards may share an axis: with-skill and baseline arms need isolated contexts, and one mining role may need several bounded chunks. Before launch, state the exact total units, capped concurrency, and why combining them would contaminate the comparison or exceed the chunk budget. Run them serially by default; an explicit A/B/mining request authorizes only these necessary units, not extra roles.
- For fan-out proposed by the executor rather than explicitly requested, obtain opt-in to that count. If the interactive question tool is unavailable or the user does not answer, take the lighter evidence path; silence is not consent.

If a unit is neither a distinct role/output nor a necessary isolated arm/shard, do not spawn it.

Before preparing disk inputs for an authorized evaluation, declare the necessary
paths and one cumulative byte budget covering every arm, retry and evidence file,
with an explicit minimum free-space reserve and session owner. Use the executable
prepare → monitored run → finish contract in
[materialization-budget.md](materialization-budget.md). Read its measured
usage and terminal state; finish on success, failure and interruption, retaining
changed inputs and evidence. Missing limits stop preparation; sampling is not a hard
filesystem quota. The runner stops on observed overage; the agent must still
justify scope and verify the business outcome.

Escalate when a lower tier exposes unresolved behavior or contradictory evidence. A user's request to cancel or de-escalate evaluation immediately stops already-launched paired eval agents, baselines, graders, aggregation, and viewer work. Keep the risk classification if it remains informative, but report only the evidence actually run and the axes left unchecked; do not describe an unrun heavy suite as automatically "required" by the label. Do not cancel discipline #5's single fresh-context reviewer when its rule/contract/number threshold is crossed, or any safety gate needed to prevent destructive or external effects. The mechanical existing-skill migration audit, public-skill sanitization, and any domain-specific safety gate also remain independent of this router.

For independent review, use [independent-review-protocol.md](independent-review-protocol.md) when a rule, contract or number changes; a typo or pure formatting change retains its exemption. Run checks selected by the tier and the existing-Skill [migration gate](existing-skill-migration.md).

For improvements, apply the selected tier evidence; authoritative facts and deterministic checks serve Tier 1, 1–2 named with-skill examples serve Tier 2, and paired results apply only within their separately authorized plan. A user cancellation remains in force for the rest of the task until explicit reauthorization. Stop when the selected evidence resolves the changed behavior; do not add a baseline, benchmark, viewer or iteration workspace to ordinary Tier 1/2 work.

## Calibrate checks before writing or trusting them

Read this section when writing a validator, gate or acceptance recipe, or before relying on an instrument whose behavior is unverified. It does not add a review team or evaluation pipeline. Stop when the affected predicates have known-answer controls and the result evidence can falsify the rule.

6. **Design the checks you write so they cannot self-certify green.** Skills are largely made of checks — gates, checklists, "before you ship" steps — and a check that the executing context can pass *while violating the very rule it encodes* is worse than no check, because it manufactures confidence. The rules below are borrowed from fields that solved this before software:
   - **The verification must cover every clause of its rule.** If the rule says "A + B + C," the evidence must demand proof of A, *and* B, *and* C separately. One confirm line bolted onto a three-clause rule gets satisfied by whichever clause the author already did; the others are invisible. Real case: a report-authoring skill carried a delivery gate whose rule read "options as side-by-side chips + recommendation highlighted + **background written as complete, self-sufficient sentences a stranger could follow**" — but the evidence line under it asked only for "N decision items, all rendered as chips." The author ran the gate, wrote that evidence, self-certified green, and shipped a page whose labels were single characters with all the context deleted. The rule sat in the file the entire time; the check simply never measured that clause.
   - **A check that misfires on healthy input is worse than no check.** The failure above is a check that passes when it should fail; this is its mirror — a check that fails when it should pass. It is the more expensive one, because it teaches the operator to bypass reflexively (`--no-verify`, `SKIP=1`, `--force`), and once that reflex exists the gate is off for *every* input, including the ones it was built for. So when authoring a fail-closed check, **false positives outrank false negatives**: missing one real problem costs you that instance, while killing one healthy input costs you the entire gate.
     Watch for the tell: **the frustration of having hit the same trap repeatedly is itself the risk signal** — it is exactly the state in which an author ships a defense that was never calibrated against healthy input. Real case: after stepping on one formatting trap three times in a day, the author added a regex check to a linter; it killed **33 healthy inputs** on the project's own corpus and was reverted the same hour. Calibrate before you arm it — run any fail-closed check across real, known-good material and confirm zero false positives; prefer loosening it until it occasionally misses over letting it ever misfire. **And the corpus itself must contain real agent outputs, not only fixtures you constructed: a fresh agent's natural phrasing variation defeats fixed fixtures.** (2026-09-19: two constructed corpora passed a gate checker while a real replay's natural Chinese wording — 「在动作集」 for the template's 「入动作集」 — silently voided the checker's core semantic check; only the third real corpus caught it.) **After each fix round, convert that round's adversarial probes into the regression corpus** (attack probes → recall arm, controls → false-positive arm), copied into the bundle so `unittest discover` re-runs the whole bidirectional calibration — otherwise the next round re-finds the same holes and the corpus never learns. Convergence judging (shape of findings, not count) lives in [references/independent-review-protocol.md](independent-review-protocol.md).
   - **Make each item a falsifiable observation, not a self-assessment.** "Background is self-sufficient" cannot be failed by the person who wrote it; "cover the rest of the page, read one card alone, and state what it is deciding" can. Prefer checks that yield an artifact — a command's output, a quoted line, a screenshot — over checks that yield an opinion.
   - **The same suspicion applies to the checks you *run*, not just the ones you write.** These rules govern checks that ship inside a skill. But the greps, finds and one-off scripts you use to verify your **own** work are instruments too, and a wrong instrument reports a clean result just as confidently as a right one. In one 2026-07 session five separate verification commands lied in both directions: a `find` without `-L` reported an installed skill's files missing (they were behind a symlink); a `grep --exclude-dir=<name>` hid a second copy of the very thing being audited; an inverted shell condition raised a false alarm that a removal had not happened; a regex spanning newlines invented 55 "lost quotations"; and a search over two of five files reported two rules missing that were present in the third. **Every one of them was believed at first, and every one was caught only by re-running a differently-shaped check.**

     The fix is the oldest one in experimental practice: **run the instrument on a case whose answer you already know before trusting it on the case you don't.** Grepping for a string you expect to be absent? First grep for one you know is present, in the same command shape — if that returns 0 too, the command is broken, not the file. This costs one line and converts "I checked" into "I checked with an instrument I calibrated."

     **"Differently-shaped" means a different *predicate*, not a different command.** Two programs that decide the same question the same way are one instrument billed twice, and running both feels exactly like corroboration — it produces two numbers that agree, which is the shape of evidence. Real case (2026-09): a new check reported which bundled references were unreachable; a separate script written to confirm it returned the same count, and that agreement was written up as "calibrated, no false positives." Both asked *does the full path `references/<name>` appear in SKILL.md* — so both were blind to the same healthy form (a `### references/` section listing each file by bare name), and a correct skill was flagged. The known-answer sample above would have caught it in one line; a second implementation of the same rule never could. Before calling a cross-check independent, say out loud what question each side asks — if it is the same sentence, you have one instrument.

     Two specific shapes worth memorizing, because both appeared above and both fail *silently*: `find` does not follow symlinks without `-L` (and skill installs are frequently symlinks into a source repo), and `--exclude-dir` matches by basename everywhere in the tree, not just at the path you had in mind.

     **And there is a second half to this rule that only bites when the check SHIPS: calibrate against the *standard* implementation, not the one on your machine.** The instrument rule above keeps *your* conclusion honest; this keeps the *reader's* working. A tool-behavior claim written into a skill — a flag, a recursion mode, an option that "follows symlinks" — is executed on machines whose binaries you have never seen, and the divergence is silent on both ends: it works when you test it, and it quietly does nothing for them. Two mechanisms produce this, and both are invisible from inside a session: **the same command name resolves to a different program** (a shell alias or function shadowing the binary — note `\tool` only escapes an *alias*, so `command tool` or an absolute path is the only deterministic form), and **the same program behaves differently across implementations** (BSD vs GNU vs a drop-in replacement). Real case (2026-07): an author verified that `grep -R` follows symlinks, wrote it into a skill as the fix for a symlink trap, and shipped it to a 1200-star public repo — their `grep` was ugrep via a shell function; on macOS's own `/usr/bin/grep` the same `-R` matches nothing (it needs `-RS`), so the prescribed fix failed silently for most readers, inside the very section warning that validators fail silently.

     So: **before a tool-behavior assertion enters a shipped artifact, re-run it against the standard binary** (`/usr/bin/<tool>`), not the one your shell hands you. If it does not survive that, do not write the flag — **prefer the implementation-independent formulation**: resolve the path yourself (`readlink -f`) instead of betting on a recursion flag, do a substring test in a script instead of a line-oriented match, name the *behavior* you need instead of the option you happen to know. A prescription that only works in your environment is worse than no prescription, because the reader has no way to discover that it silently did nothing.

   - **Use what mature checklist practice already settled.** Decide whether a list is **READ-DO** (execute while reading — for low-frequency or unfamiliar procedures) or **DO-CONFIRM** (work from expertise, then stop at a defined **pause point** and confirm — for experienced operators under time pressure), and anchor it at a real pause point rather than "somewhere in the workflow." Keep it to the **killer items** — critical *and* commonly missed under pressure, roughly five to nine; everything beyond that dilutes compliance ([Gawande, *The Checklist Manifesto*](https://www.shortform.com/blog/types-of-checklists/)). And prefer Shingo's **control** over **warning** ([poka-yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke)): a prose reminder depends on vigilance and loses to completion-drive, while a step that blocks progress or forces an artifact needs no vigilance at all. Where a skill can only warn, at least put the warning where the decision gets made — **a rule filed in a reference the executing context never opens is not, in practice, a rule.**

   - **A check can also self-certify by being *vacuous* — it examines zero of the thing it claims to examine, and passes.** The rules above catch a check that measures the wrong clause, misfires on healthy input, or rests on an uncalibrated instrument. Vacuous green looks like all of those passing: the run completes, exit 0, the assertion fires. The tell is a **count**: ask "how many items did this actually examine?" and have the case assert it, not just the exit code. Real case (2026-09-22): a dangling-reference gate's test case asserted `exit == 0` while its own fixture printed "0 citations examined" — the candidate set had been emptied, so nothing ever entered it. The number was in the output the whole time. So: **every gate test asserts the examined-item count against an expected value**, and a count of 0 on a fixture that demonstrably contains N items is a red test, not a green one.

     The only detector for vacuity is **mutation testing**: break the mechanism under test and confirm the affected case goes red. A case that survives every mutation has not been shown to test anything, however green it stays. Two constraints, learned by repairing the same case twice and still shipping it vacuous: ① **the mutation must remove the mechanism under test, not a convenient neighbour** — mutating a helper whose output a later line discards, or mutating a token that never enters the candidate set (too short, missing the delimiter the scanner keys on), leaves the case green for a reason unrelated to your rule; ② **a still-green mutated build means "my test never touched this", not "my test is robust"**. Convert each round's mutation into a permanent case alongside the false-positive arm above, or the next round re-finds the same hole.

For historical evidence behind these procedures, inspect [developer-casebook.md](developer-casebook.md) only when investigating that failure.
