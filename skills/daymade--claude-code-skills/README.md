## 🌟 Essential Skill: skill-creator

**⭐ Start here if you want to create your own skills!**

The `skill-creator` is the **meta-skill** that enables you to build, validate, and package your own Claude Code skills. It's the most important tool in this marketplace because it empowers you to extend Claude Code with your own specialized workflows.

### Why This skill-creator?

This is a **production-hardened fork** of [Anthropic's official skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator), born from building real skills and hitting every wall the official version doesn't warn you about.

**The official skill-creator tells you _what_ to build. Ours also tells you _what not to try_ — and why.**

| You're trying to... | Official | This Fork |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Research before building | "Check available MCPs" (5 lines) | 8-channel search protocol with decision matrix: Adopt / Extend / Build |
| Create a skill interactively | Prose-based instructions | 9 structured AskUserQuestion checkpoints — user never loses context |
| Avoid common mistakes | No guidance | Cache edit warnings, prerequisite checks, security scan gate |
| Know the architecture options | Not mentioned | Inline vs Fork decision guide with examples (choosing wrong silently breaks your skill) |
| Validate before shipping | Basic YAML check | Expanded validator (all frontmatter fields, path reference integrity, whitespace issues) |
| Catch security issues | No tooling | `security_scan.py` with gitleaks integration — hard gate before packaging |
| Learn from real failures | No failure cases | Battle-tested methodology with documented failure patterns and gotchas |

**Quality comparison** (independent audit, 8 dimensions):

| Dimension | Official | This Fork |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Actionability | 7 | 9 |
| Error Prevention | 5 | 9 |
| Prior Art Research | 4 | 9 |
| Counter Review Process | 4 | 8 |
| Real-World Lessons | 3 | 8 |
| User Experience | 4 | 9 |
| **Total (out of 80)** | **42** | **65** |

### 17. **prompt-optimizer** - Prompt Engineering with EARS Methodology

Transform vague prompts into precise, well-structured specifications using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) - a methodology created by Rolls-Royce for converting natural language into testable requirements.

**Methodology inspired by:** [阿星AI工作室 (A-Xing AI Studio)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yUVX-9FovSq7ZGChkHpuXQ), which pioneered combining EARS with domain theory grounding for practical prompt enhancement.

**When to use:**
- Converting loose requirements into structured specifications
- Optimizing prompts for AI code generation or content creation
- Breaking down vague feature requests into atomic, testable statements
- Adding domain theory grounding to technical requirements
- Transforming "build X" requests into detailed implementation specs
- Learning prompt engineering best practices with proven frameworks

**Key features:**
- **EARS transformation**: 5 sentence patterns (ubiquitous, event-driven, state-driven, conditional, unwanted behavior)
- **6-step optimization workflow**: Analyze → Transform → Identify theories → Extract examples → Enhance → Present
- **Domain theory catalog**: 40+ frameworks mapped to 10 domains (productivity, UX, gamification, learning, e-commerce, security)
- **Structured prompt framework**: Role/Skills/Workflows/Examples/Formats template
- **Advanced techniques**: Multi-stakeholder requirements, non-functional specs, complex conditional logic
- **Complete examples**: Procrastination app, e-commerce product page, learning dashboard, password reset
- **Theory grounding**: GTD, BJ Fogg Behavior Model, Gestalt Principles, AIDA, Zero Trust, and more
- **Progressive disclosure**: Bundled references (ears_syntax.md, domain_theories.md, examples.md)

**Example usage:**
```markdown
# Before (vague)
"Build me a password reset feature"

# After EARS transformation (7 atomic requirements)
1. When user clicks "Forgot Password", the system shall display email input field
2. When user submits valid email, the system shall send password reset link valid for 1 hour
3. When user clicks reset link, the system shall verify token has not expired
4. When token is valid, the system shall display password creation form requiring minimum 12 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character
5. When user submits new password meeting requirements, the system shall hash password with bcrypt and invalidate reset token
6. When user attempts password reset more than 3 times in 1 hour, the system shall block further attempts for 1 hour
7. If reset token has expired, the system shall display error message and option to request new link

# Enhanced with domain theories
- Zero Trust Architecture (verify at each step)
- Defense in Depth (rate limiting + token expiration + password complexity)
- Progressive Disclosure (multi-step UX flow)

# Full prompt includes Role, Skills, Workflows, Examples, Formats
```

**🎬 Live Demo**

*Coming soon*

📚 **Documentation**: See [prompt-optimizer/references/](./prompt-optimizer/references/) for:
- `ears_syntax.md` - Complete EARS patterns and transformation rules
- `domain_theories.md` - 40+ theories mapped to domains with selection guidance
- `examples.md` - Full transformation examples with before/after comparisons

**💡 Innovation**: EARS methodology eliminates ambiguity by forcing explicit conditions, triggers, and measurable criteria. Combined with domain theory grounding (GTD, BJ Fogg, Gestalt, etc.), it transforms "build a todo app" into a complete specification with behavioral psychology principles, UX best practices, and concrete test cases - enabling test-driven development from day one.

### 26. **macos-cleaner** - Intelligent macOS Disk Space Recovery

**The safest way to reclaim disk space on macOS.** Analyze system caches, application remnants, large files, and development environments with intelligent categorization and interactive cleanup.

**Why macos-cleaner stands out:**
- **Safety-First Philosophy**: Never deletes without explicit user confirmation. Every operation includes risk assessment (🟢 Safe / 🟡 Caution / 🔴 Keep).
- **Intelligence Over Automation**: Analyzes first, explains thoroughly, then lets you decide. Unlike one-click cleaners that blindly delete, we help you understand what you're removing and why.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Deep analysis of Docker, Homebrew, npm, pip caches - tools that generic cleaners miss.
- **Transparent & Educational**: Every recommendation includes an explanation of what the file is, why it's safe (or not), and what happens if you delete it.
- **Professional Quality**: Built by developers who know the pain of accidentally deleting important files. Includes comprehensive safety checks and Time Machine backup recommendations.

**Our design principles:**
1. **User Control First**: You make the decisions, we provide the insights
2. **Explain Everything**: No mysterious deletions - full transparency on impact
3. **Conservative Defaults**: When uncertain, we preserve rather than delete
4. **Developer Context**: Understand development tool caches, not just system files
5. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine script precision with visual tools (Mole integration)

**When to use:**
- Your Mac is running out of disk space (>80% full)
- You're a developer with Docker/npm/pip/Homebrew caches piling up
- You want to understand what's consuming space, not just delete blindly
- You need to clean up after uninstalled applications
- You prefer understanding over automation

**Key features:**
- **Smart Cache Analysis**: Categorizes system caches, app caches, logs by safety level
- **Application Remnant Detection**: Finds orphaned data from uninstalled apps with confidence scoring
- **Large File Discovery**: Intelligent categorization (videos, archives, databases, disk images, build artifacts)
- **Development Environment Cleanup**: Docker (images, containers, volumes, build cache), Homebrew, npm, pip, old Git repos
- **Interactive Safe Deletion**: Batch confirmation, selective deletion, undo-friendly (uses Trash when possible)
- **Before/After Reports**: Track space recovery with detailed breakdown
- **Mole Integration**: Seamless workflow with visual cleanup tool for GUI preferences
- **Risk Categorization**: Every item labeled with safety level and explanation
- **Time Machine Awareness**: Recommends backups before large deletions (>10 GB)

**What makes us different:**
- ✅ **Trust Through Transparency**: Other cleaners hide what they delete. We show everything and explain why.
- ✅ **Developer-Centric**: We clean Docker, not just browser caches. We understand `.git` directories, `node_modules`, and build artifacts.
- ✅ **Safety Checks Built-In**: Protection against deleting system files, user data, credentials, active databases, or files in use.
- ✅ **Educational**: Learn what's safe to delete and why, so you can maintain your Mac confidently.
- ❌ **Not a One-Click Solution**: We don't delete automatically. If you want "clean everything now", use other tools. We're for users who want control.

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Install the skill
claude plugin install macos-cleaner@daymade-skills

# Ask Claude Code to analyze your Mac
"My Mac is running out of space, help me analyze what's using storage"

# Claude will:
# 1. Run comprehensive disk analysis
# 2. Present categorized findings with safety levels
# 3. Explain each category (caches, remnants, large files, dev tools)
# 4. Recommend cleanup approach
# 5. Execute ONLY what you confirm

# Example analysis output:
📊 Disk Space Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total:     500 GB
Used:      450 GB (90%)
Available:  50 GB (10%)

🟢 Safe to Clean (95 GB):
  - System caches:     45 GB (apps regenerate automatically)
  - Homebrew cache:     5 GB (reinstalls when needed)
  - npm cache:          3 GB (safe to clear)
  - Old logs:           8 GB (diagnostic data only)
  - Trash:             34 GB (already marked for deletion)

🟡 Review Recommended (62 GB):
  - Large downloads:   38 GB (may contain important files)
  - App remnants:       8 GB (verify apps are truly uninstalled)
  - Docker images:     12 GB (may be in use)
  - Old .git repos:     4 GB (verify project is archived)

🔴 Keep Unless Certain (0 GB):
  - No high-risk items detected

Recommendation: Start with 🟢 Safe items (95 GB), then review 🟡 items together.

### 42. **continue-claude-work** - Resume Interrupted Claude Work

Recover actionable context from local `~/.claude` session artifacts and continue implementation without reopening the old interactive session. Uses a bundled Python script for intelligent context extraction.

**When to use:**
- A user provides a Claude session ID and wants the task continued
- You need to inspect local `.claude` JSONL files instead of running `claude --resume`
- A previous session was interrupted and the next concrete step must be reconstructed
- A multi-agent workflow was interrupted and you need to know which subagents completed

**Key features:**
- Compact-boundary-aware extraction — reads Claude's own session compaction summaries as highest-signal context
- Subagent workflow recovery — reports completed vs. interrupted subagents with last outputs
- Session end reason detection — classifies clean exit, interrupted (ctrl-c), error cascade, or abandoned
- Size-adaptive strategy — different reading approaches for small (<500KB) vs. large (>5MB) sessions
- Noise filtering — skips progress/queue-operation/api_error messages (37-53% of session lines)
- Self-session exclusion, stale index fallback, MEMORY.md integration, git workspace state

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Install the skill
claude plugin install continue-claude-work@daymade-skills

# Then ask Claude to resume from local artifacts
"continue work from session 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
"don't resume, just read the .claude files and continue"
"check what I was working on in the last session and keep going"
```

📚 **Documentation**: See [continue-claude-work/SKILL.md](./continue-claude-work/SKILL.md).

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+, `git` for workspace reconciliation.
