## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude **Skills** are specialized modules that Claude can use to perform structured, multi-step tasks. Each skill is a lightweight folder with a clear instruction interface, and optionally includes Python code, templates, and assets.

Skills allow Claude to:
- Create and edit documents (Word, Excel, PPT)
- Parse and analyze structured data
- Write and debug code
- Generate creative visual assets
- Automate research, testing, or collaboration tasks

Official Skills are created by Anthropic and auto-invoked when needed. You can also install or build custom skills to meet your unique workflow needs.

## Getting Started

To use a skill:
1. Clone the [Anthropic Claude Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repo.
2. Enable Code Execution and Skill loading in Claude.
3. Upload the skill folder (or link to a Git repo with an `SKILL.md`).
4. Ask Claude to activate or use the skill!

## Skill Quality Standards & Template

Writing a great skill starts with a well-structured `SKILL.md` file. [AgentSkills.io](https://agentskills.io) provides the canonical specification for the Claude Skills format, including validation rules and a detailed checklist. Anthropic also publishes best practices for skill authoring at [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com).

### Minimal SKILL.md Template

Every skill should include a `SKILL.md` with proper YAML frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: |
  Generates weekly status reports from project data.
  Use when the user asks for a summary of recent activity.
---
```

The body of `SKILL.md` (below the frontmatter) contains the instructions Claude follows when the skill is activated.

### Key Quality Criteria

- **name** -- Use `kebab-case`, 1-64 characters (e.g., `csv-data-summarizer`, not `CSV Data Summarizer`).
- **description** -- Write in third person. State *what* the skill does and *when* to use it. Keep it under 300 characters.
- **Body length** -- Keep the instruction body under 500 lines. Long skills should be split into focused sub-skills.
- **Progressive disclosure** -- Start with the most common usage, then cover edge cases. Claude reads top-down, so put the critical path first.
- **No secrets in source** -- Never embed API keys, tokens, or credentials in `SKILL.md`. Use environment variables or MCP configuration instead.

### Reference Implementations

- [AgentSkills.io Validation Checklist](https://agentskills.io) -- Use this to validate your `SKILL.md` before publishing.
- [Anthropic Skill Authoring Guide](https://platform.claude.com) -- Official best practices from Anthropic.
