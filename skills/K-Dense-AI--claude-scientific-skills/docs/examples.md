  images and any re-identification key in approved separate storage
- Load WSI files (SVS, TIFF formats)
- Extract only allowlisted, non-identifying metadata and magnification levels
- Visualize slide thumbnails
- Inspect tissue area vs background

Step 2: Tile extraction and preprocessing
- Split by patient and then slide before tiling or fitting preprocessing

- Balance classes through stratified sampling

Step 4: Set up PathML pipeline
- Create PathML SlideData objects
- Define preprocessing pipeline:
  * Stain normalization
  * Color augmentation (HSV jitter)
  * Rotation and flipping
- Apply the predeclared patient-level train/validation/test split and audit leakage

Step 9: Model interpretability with SHAP
- Apply GradCAM or SHAP to explain predictions
- Visualize which regions contribute to tumor classification
- Generate attention maps showing model focus
- Ask qualified reviewers to inspect focus patterns; attribution maps do not validate
  pathology reasoning, causality, or diagnostic performance

Step 10: Retrospective research evaluation
- Compare model outputs with authorized pathologist-supplied research labels
- Calculate inter-rater agreement (kappa score)
- Identify discordant cases for review
- Analyze error types: false positives, false negatives

- After explicit authorization, use the Benchling API to:
  * Retrieve compound information (structure, batch, concentration)
  * Log plate creation in inventory
  * Create transfer records for audit trail
  * Link assay plates to ELN entry

Step 8: Pass the physical-execution safety gate
- A trained operator verifies calibration, deck state, consumables, volumes,
  hazards, waste handling, emergency stop/recovery, and instrument readiness

  small dry run before deciding whether to execute the campaign
- The agent does not connect to or command hardware automatically

Step 9: Collect and process data
- Export raw luminescence data from plate reader
- Load data with Polars for fast processing
- Normalize data:
  * Subtract background (media-only wells)
  * Calculate % viability relative to DMSO control
  * Apply plate-wise normalization to correct systematic effects
- Quality control:
  * Z' factor calculation (> 0.5 for acceptable assay)
  * Coefficient of variation for controls (< 10%)
  * Flag plates with poor QC metrics

Step 10: Dose-response curve fitting
- Fit 4-parameter logistic curves for each compound
- Calculate IC50, Hill slope, max/min response

  * Protocol documentation from Protocols.io
  * Raw data files and analysis code
  * Recommendations for confirmation assays
- Prepare a reviewed Benchling/ELN update and execute it only with explicit authorization
- Export PDF report for stakeholders

Expected Output:

- `scientific-slides` - Presentation materials
- `latex-posters` - Conference posters
- `pptx-posters` - Macro-free `.pptx` posters from approved local manifests
- `pdf` - PDF report generation

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Plan visual communication strategy
- Separate data figures from conceptual/AI-generated illustrations; never use image
  generation to invent observations, labels, scale, or quantitative evidence
- Confirm authorization before sending any source image or unpublished/sensitive
  content to an external image service
- Identify key concepts that need visual representation:
  * Experimental workflow diagrams
  * Molecular structures and interactions
  * Data visualization (handled by matplotlib)
  * Conceptual illustrations for mechanisms
  * Graphical abstract for paper summary
- Determine appropriate style for target journal/audience
- Sketch rough layouts for each figure

Step 2: Generate experimental workflow diagram
- Use generate-image skill with detailed prompt:
  "Scientific illustration showing a step-by-step experimental 
  workflow for CRISPR gene editing: (1) guide RNA design at computer,
  (2) cell culture in petri dish, (3) electroporation device,
  (4) selection with antibiotics, (5) sequencing validation.
  Clean, professional style with numbered steps, white background,
  suitable for scientific publication."
- Save as workflow_diagram.png
- Record model, prompt, output, edits, and source/permission metadata; have a domain
  expert verify every depicted scientific detail

Step 3: Create molecular interaction schematic
- Generate detailed molecular visualization:
  "Scientific diagram of protein-ligand binding mechanism:
  show receptor protein (blue ribbon structure) with binding pocket,
  small molecule ligand (ball-and-stick, orange) approaching,
  key hydrogen bonds indicated with dashed lines, water molecules
  in binding site. Professional biochemistry illustration style,
  clean white background, publication quality."
- Generate multiple versions with different angles/styles
- Select best representation

Step 4: Edit existing figures for consistency
- Use the generate-image skill's supported host interface to request a background
  or palette edit only after confirming permission to process the source image
- Standardize color schemes across all figures
- Preserve the untouched original and record each transformation
- Verify current journal requirements directly rather than assuming an edit makes
  the figure compliant

Step 5: Generate graphical abstract
- Create comprehensive visual summary:
  "Graphical abstract for cancer immunotherapy paper: left side
  shows tumor cells (irregular shapes, red) being attacked by
  T cells (round, blue). Center shows the drug molecule structure.
  Right side shows healthy tissue (green). Arrow flow from left
  to right indicating treatment progression. Modern, clean style
  with minimal text, high contrast, suitable for journal TOC."
- Ensure dimensions meet journal requirements
- Iterate to highlight key findings

Step 6: Create conceptual mechanism illustrations
- Generate mechanism diagrams:
  "Scientific illustration of enzyme catalysis mechanism:
  Show substrate entering active site (step 1), transition state
  formation with electron movement arrows (step 2), product
  release (step 3). Use standard biochemistry notation,
  curved arrows for electron movement, clear labeling."
- Generate alternative representations for supplementary materials

Step 7: Produce presentation-ready figures
- Create high-impact visuals for talks:
  "Eye-catching scientific illustration of DNA double helix
  unwinding during replication, with DNA polymerase (large
  green structure) adding nucleotides. Dynamic composition,
  vibrant but professional colors, dark background for
  presentation slides."
- Adjust style for poster vs slide format
- Create versions at different resolutions

Step 8: Generate figure panels for multi-part figures
- Create consistent series of related images:
  "Panel A: Normal cell with intact membrane (green outline)
  Panel B: Cell under oxidative stress with damaged membrane
  Panel C: Cell treated with antioxidant, membrane recovering
  Consistent style across all panels, same scale, white background,
  scientific illustration style suitable for publication."
- Ensure visual consistency across panels
- Annotate with panel labels

Step 9: Edit for accessibility
- Use redundant encodings, labels, patterns, and an audited contrast-aware palette
- If an authorized AI edit changes colors, compare it against the original and
  verify that no scientific content or spatial relationship changed
- Add patterns or textures for additional differentiation
- Run contrast checks and manual accessibility review; do not claim that palette
  selection alone establishes accessibility

Step 10: Create supplementary visual materials
- Generate additional context figures:
  "Anatomical diagram showing location of pancreatic islets
  within the pancreas, cross-section view with labeled structures:
  alpha cells, beta cells, blood vessels. Medical illustration
  style, educational, suitable for supplementary materials."
- Create protocol flowcharts and decision trees
- Generate equipment setup diagrams

Step 11: Compile figure legends and captions
- Use scientific-writing skill to create descriptions:
  * Figure number and title
  * Detailed description of what is shown
  * Explanation of symbols, colors, and abbreviations
  * Scale bars and measurement units
  * Statistical information if applicable
- Format according to journal guidelines
- Map factual and numerical caption claims to verified evidence IDs

Step 12: Assemble final publication package
- Organize all figures in publication order
- Verify the target venue's current dimensions, resolution, color-space, font,
  accessibility, and submission requirements before export
- Compile into PDF using pdf skill:
  * Title page with graphical abstract
  * All figures with captions
  * Supplementary figures section
- Create separate folder with individual figure files
- Document all generation prompts for reproducibility
- For a PowerPoint poster, build an author-approved local content/asset manifest,
  validate hashes, provenance, printer rules, reading order, and approval hash,
  then generate and inspect a macro-free `.pptx`; final review/export is manual

Expected Output:
- Complete set of source-traceable, human-reviewed scientific illustrations
- Graphical abstract for table of contents
- Mechanism diagrams and workflow figures
- Edited versions checked against current journal guidance
- Accessibility-reviewed figure versions with redundant encodings
- Figure package with captions and metadata
- Documentation of prompts used for reproducibility

- Track metrics (AUC, Dice/IoU for segmentation)

Step 4: Evaluation and interpretability
- Evaluate on the held-out set with confidence intervals
- Use SHAP/saliency to inspect model behavior; explanations do not establish
  causality, diagnostic validity, or clinical relevance

Step 5: Aggregate research evaluation and governance
- Use clinical-decision-support only with aggregate or synthetic metrics to prepare
  intended-use limits, cohort/performance tables, privacy review, and governance gates
- Do not diagnose, triage, alert, choose treatment, calculate a dose, or operate live
- Record external-validation, bias, calibration, workflow, and authorization gaps

Step 6: Report
- Performance metrics, example predictions with heatmaps
- Interpretability limits, privacy controls, cohort scope, and non-diagnostic caveats
- Draft with scientific-writing and map each factual/numerical claim to verified evidence

Expected Output:
- Trained, interpreted imaging model on IDC data
- Aggregate research evaluation/governance packet
- Evidence-traceable, non-diagnostic validation report

## Research Ideation & Study Planning

### Example 31: From Idea to a Powered, Well-Designed Study

**Objective**: Move from open-ended ideation to transparent candidate hypotheses and a statistically powered study plan without treating any candidate as validated or automatically selecting a winner.

**Skills Used**:
- `scientific-brainstorming` - Open-ended ideation and gap-finding
- `consciousness-council` - Multi-perspective deliberation on directions
- `what-if-oracle` - Structured scenario/branch analysis
- `hypothesis-generation` - Formalize evidence-bounded candidates and rival predictions
- `hypogenic` - Produce candidate textual patterns from labeled text datasets
- `experimental-design` - Choose design, randomization, and blocking
- `statistical-power` - Sample size, MDE, and power curves

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Diverge — generate ideas
- Use scientific-brainstorming to explore the problem space and interdisciplinary links
- Run a consciousness-council deliberation to weigh competing research directions

Step 2: Stress-test directions
- Use what-if-oracle to explore best/likely/worst/contrarian scenarios for top ideas
- Record assumptions, objections, vetoes, uncertainty, and reasons a human team
  retains, revises, or sets aside a direction

Step 3: Formalize hypotheses
- Convert the chosen direction into testable hypotheses with hypothesis-generation
- If an approved labeled text dataset exists, use HypoGeniC to produce candidate
  textual hypotheses and held-out task statistics
- Do not treat HypoGeniC accuracy as truth, causal evidence, novelty, or scientific
  validation, and do not automatically score, rank, select, accept, or reject hypotheses

Step 4: Design the study
- Use experimental-design to select a design (factorial, RCT, block, crossover),
  define randomization, blocking, and treatment combinations

Step 5: Power and sample size
- Use statistical-power for a priori power analysis, minimum detectable effect,
  and power curves across plausible effect sizes

Step 6: Deliverable
- A human-reviewed, preregistration-ready plan: candidate/rival set, discriminating
  predictions, design diagram, analysis plan, oversight gates, and justified sample size

Expected Output:
- A documented set of candidate hypotheses, rivals, assumptions, and human decisions
- A concrete experimental design with randomization/blocking
- Power analysis and sample-size justification
```

## Literature & Knowledge Management

### Example 32: Systematic Literature Review and Research Knowledge Base

**Objective**: Run a multi-source literature search, ingest and organize sources, and synthesize a cited, well-managed review.

**Skills Used**:
- `research-lookup` - Routed current-research search (web/deep/academic)
- `exa-search` - Semantic web search tuned for technical content
- `parallel-web` - Academic-focused web search/fetch and enrichment
- `bgpt-paper-search` - Structured experimental data extracted from papers
- `paperzilla` - Canonical papers and project recommendations
- `liteparse` - Local PDF/Office parsing with layout/bounding boxes
- `markitdown` - Convert documents to Markdown
- `open-notebook` - Organize sources into AI research notebooks
- `pyzotero` - Manage a Zotero reference library
- `scholar-evaluation` - Qualitative, low-stakes developmental review of works
- `citation-management` - Reference formatting
- `literature-review` - Systematic synthesis

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Multi-source search
- Use research-lookup to route queries; broaden with exa-search and parallel-web
- Pull structured study fields (sample sizes, methods, outcomes) via bgpt-paper-search
- Surface canonical references and recommendations with paperzilla

Step 2: Ingest and normalize sources
- Parse local PDFs/Office files with liteparse (layout + bounding boxes)
- Convert mixed documents to clean Markdown with markitdown
- Organize everything into an open-notebook research notebook

Step 3: Reference management
- Store and de-duplicate references in Zotero via pyzotero
- Tag by theme, method, and evidence level

Step 4: Critical appraisal
- Use scholar-evaluation for qualitative, evidence-traceable developmental review
  of each authorized scholarly work
- If a predeclared low-stakes rubric is useful, treat optional scores only as
  bounded anchor summaries with uncertainty—not measurements of quality
- Never score or rank authors, reviewers, institutions, or other people, and never
  use the output for consequential personnel, admissions, funding, or award decisions

Step 5: Synthesize
- Use the literature-review skill to synthesize themes, gaps, and consensus/conflicts
- Format citations with citation-management

Step 6: Deliverable
- A cited systematic review with evidence tables and a managed reference library

Expected Output:
- Comprehensive multi-source search results
- Organized, parsed, and reference-managed corpus
- Qualitatively appraised, synthesized, fully cited literature review
```

## Regulatory & Quality Management

### Example 33: ISO 13485 QMS Evidence Preparation for Device Software

**Objective**: Prepare draft QMS scope, controlled-document scaffolds, and evidence manifests for qualified ISO 13485 readiness review. The workflow does not determine legal applicability, compliance, audit outcome, or certification.

**Skills Used**:
- `iso-13485-certification` - Draft scope, controlled-document, and evidence preparation
- `scientific-writing` - Evidence provenance and accountable draft controls
- `markdown-mermaid-writing` - Process diagrams and SOP flowcharts
- `docx` - Formatted Word deliverables
- `pdf` - Final controlled documents

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Authorized evidence inventory
- Confirm access to the applicable licensed standard and current jurisdiction-specific
  requirements through qualified RA/QA or legal owners
- Use iso-13485-certification to inventory supplied documents, implementation records,
  evidence status, owners, and unresolved blockers
- Do not infer readiness or conformity from filenames, keywords, document counts,
  percentages, templates, or script results

Step 2: Draft QMS scope and evidence boundaries
- Record organization, sites, products, processes, outsourced activities, exclusions,
  and interfaces exactly as supplied by authorized management/RA/QA
- Keep ISO 13485, FDA QMSR, MDSAP, and EU MDR/IVDR evidence mappings distinct
- Preserve applicability, classification, claims, and legal decisions as qualified-review items

Step 3: Prepare controlled-document scaffolds
- Draft only source-bound procedures, work-instruction outlines, and quality-manual
  sections whose owners, inputs, responsibilities, records, and approvals are supplied
- Diagram processes (design controls, CAPA, risk management) with markdown-mermaid-writing
- Label every artifact as draft evidence-preparation material for authorized review

Step 4: Produce review copies
- Export draft procedures and manual sections to DOCX
- Generate review PDFs with document IDs, versions, owners, status, and unresolved
  placeholders; do not sign, approve, release, submit, or represent them as controlled

Step 5: Traceability
- Build a requirements/evidence traceability matrix from authorized requirement IDs
- Link objective evidence, implementation records, owners, review status, and blockers
- Route results to management, RA/QA, legal, auditors, and the certification body as appropriate

Expected Output:
- Draft evidence-readiness inventory with explicit unknowns and blockers
- Source-bound QMS document scaffolds and process diagrams
- Local traceability manifest and review copies for qualified assessment
```

## Scientific Communication & Tooling

### Example 34: Publication Packaging — Diagrams, Infographics, and Venue Formatting

**Objective**: Turn verified results into an author-reviewed draft manuscript package with source-traceable prose and visuals, current venue checks, and an optional macro-free PPTX poster.

**Skills Used**:
- `markdown-mermaid-writing` - Text-based diagrams and structured docs
- `scientific-writing` - Evidence registry, authorship, confidentiality, and consistency checks
- `scientific-schematics` - Scientific diagrams
- `infographics` - AI-generated infographics with data accuracy checks
- `venue-templates` - LaTeX templates and submission guidelines
- `markitdown` - Convert drafts/sources to Markdown
- `docx` - Word manuscript output
- `latex-posters` - Conference poster
- `pptx-posters` - Macro-free PowerPoint poster from an approved local manifest
- `pdf` - Final compiled outputs

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Structure the manuscript
- Establish an authorized local workspace, source manifest, claim/evidence registry,
  authorship/declaration records, and reporting-guideline coverage
- Draft the document in Markdown with scientific-writing; add Mermaid diagrams
- Convert existing source materials to Markdown with markitdown

Step 2: Build figures and schematics
- Create mechanism/workflow schematics with scientific-schematics
- Produce a one-page infographic summary only from verified, author-approved data
- Obtain explicit authorization before any external image service receives source
  material; record prompt/model/output provenance and manually verify every detail

Step 3: Apply venue formatting
- Use venue-templates to identify a candidate LaTeX template, then verify the current
  official author instructions and AI/disclosure policy for the exact venue and article type
  (Nature/Science/PLOS/IEEE/ACM or a target conference)

Step 4: Generate outputs
- Compile draft manuscript review copies to PDF and DOCX for authorized collaborators
- Build a conference poster with latex-posters
- If PowerPoint is requested, populate the pptx-posters local manifest with exact
  author-approved text/assets, hashes, provenance, printer requirements, reading order,
  alt text, and approval hash; generate and inspect a one-slide macro-free `.pptx`

Step 5: Final check
- Run local claim/reference/consistency checks and verify formatting, figure properties,
  accessibility, and reference style against current official venue requirements
- Accountable human authors resolve scientific issues, approve declarations and content,
  and separately authorize any submission

Expected Output:
- Author-reviewed draft manuscript package (PDF + DOCX) with evidence traceability
- Source-traceable diagrams, schematics, and infographic
- A matching LaTeX poster or inspected macro-free `.pptx` poster
```

**Skills Used**:
- `autoskill` - Detect repeated workflows and draft new skills/recipes
- `pi-agent` - Build/use the Pi terminal coding harness and skills/extensions
- `get-available-resources` - Detect local CPU/GPU/memory
- `optimize-for-gpu` - GPU-accelerate Python (CuPy/Numba/cuDF/cuML, etc.)
- `modal` - Serverless on-demand GPU/CPU deployment
- `hugging-science` - Scientific ML models to wrap as tools

**Workflow**:

```bash
Step 1: Discover repeated workflows
- Use autoskill only after the user asks to analyze their local screen history; review
  redaction and retain only the minimum workflow summary
- Match recurring research steps to existing skills
- Draft new skills or composition recipes for gaps

Step 2: Prototype a custom tool
- Build the tool/harness with pi-agent (Pi skills, extensions, or SDK embedding)
- Wrap a relevant hugging-science model as a callable component

Step 3: Profile and accelerate
- Run get-available-resources to size the job
- Apply optimize-for-gpu to accelerate the hot numerical paths

Step 4: Deploy to the cloud
- Prepare the Modal image, resources, secrets, network, data-egress, cost, and access plan
- Deploy only after explicit authorization for the exact project and side effects
- Expose a scheduled job or web endpoint only with reviewed authentication,
  authorization, rate limits, logging, and shutdown controls

Step 5: Document
- Document the new skill/recipe and usage for the team

Expected Output:
- New drafted skills/composition recipes for recurring work
- A reviewed deployment plan or explicitly authorized GPU-accelerated Modal tool
- Documentation for reuse
```

### How to Use These Examples

1. **Adapt within the contract**: Modify parameters, datasets, and objectives only within the current skill's scope, compatibility, and safety boundaries
2. **Combine skills creatively**: Mix and match skills from different categories
3. **Treat workflows as illustrative**: Verify current official APIs, package versions, venue rules, standards, licenses, and institutional requirements
4. **Generate reviewable output**: Prefer source manifests, claim/evidence maps, explicit assumptions, uncertainty, and draft labels over unsupported claims of readiness
5. **Cite and verify sources**: An identifier, search snippet, generated summary, or fluent draft is not source verification
6. **Keep humans accountable**: Qualified users approve scientific conclusions, clinical documentation, external transfers, submissions, regulated artifacts, and physical execution

### Additional Notes

- Always start with: "Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized."
- For complex projects, break into manageable steps and validate intermediate results
- Save checkpoints and intermediate data files
- Document parameters and decisions for reproducibility
- Generate README files explaining methodology
- Create clearly labeled review copies for stakeholder communication
- Clinical Decision Support is for aggregate/synthetic research evaluation and governance only; Clinical Reports creates source-bound draft structures; Treatment Plans only formats verified clinician-authored decisions
- PathML, NeuroKit2, pydicom, imaging models, and physiological-signal examples are research-only and not diagnostic, monitoring, treatment, or medical-device validation workflows
- PyLabRobot defaults to offline planning/simulation; all live API writes, cloud submissions, purchases, and robot/equipment actions require explicit authorization at the applicable gate
- Hypotheses remain candidates until independently tested; HypoGeniC task statistics do not validate them, and Scholar Evaluation never ranks people or supports consequential decisions
- ISO 13485 outputs are draft evidence-preparation artifacts, not compliance or certification findings; PPTX posters use author-approved local manifests and macro-free `.pptx` generation with manual final review

These examples showcase the power of combining the skills in this repository to tackle complex, real-world scientific challenges across multiple domains.
