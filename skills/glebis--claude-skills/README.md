# Claude Skills

A collection of skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) that extend AI capabilities with specialized workflows, tools, and domain expertise.

## 📦 Available Skills

### [TDD (Test-Driven Development)](./tdd/)
Multi-agent TDD orchestration with architecturally enforced context isolation. Uses Claude Code's Task tool to spawn separate subagents for test writing and implementation -- the Test Writer never sees implementation code, and the Implementer never sees the specification.

**Features:**
- Multi-agent context isolation: Test Writer, Implementer, and Refactorer run as separate Task subagents with strict information boundaries
- Strict RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR phase enforcement
- `--auto` mode: run all slices without pausing, stop only on unrecoverable errors
- Inside-out vertical slicing by architectural layer (domain -> domain-service -> application -> infrastructure)
- Layer-specific test constraints and dependency rules per slice
- `layer_map` path validation: rejects Implementer writes to wrong-layer directories
- Post-RED test lint: blocks mocking libraries in domain/domain-service tests
- Full-repo import scan: catches dependency violations in untouched files
- Port interface rule: consumer defines the contract (Dependency Inversion)
- Retry loop: up to 5 fresh Implementer attempts with previous-attempt context (no accumulated history)
- Regression auto-fix: detects and repairs broken tests after implementation (3-attempt limit)
- Greenfield project support: handles empty codebases with no existing tests
- `run_tests.sh`: universal test runner wrapping 7 frameworks into structured JSON with timeout support
- `extract_api.sh`: public API surface extractor (signatures only, no bodies) for 7 languages
- Implementer always returns complete file content (no ambiguous partial patches)
- Failure recovery table covering 11 error scenarios with concrete recovery actions
- 18 documented anti-patterns with prevention guidance (incl. service locator, Active Record bleed)
- Session state via `.tdd-state.json` with `--resume` support
- 7 frameworks: Jest, Vitest, pytest, Go test, cargo test, RSpec, PHPUnit
- Bug-fix TDD: reproduce-first workflow

**Architecture:**
```
ORCHESTRATOR (main Claude context)
├─ Phase 0: Setup (detect framework, extract API, create state)
├─ Phase 1: Decompose into vertical slices -> user approves
├─ FOR EACH SLICE:
│   ├─ Phase 2 (RED):     Task(Test Writer)  <- spec + API only
│   ├─ Phase 3 (GREEN):   Task(Implementer)  <- failing test + error only
│   └─ Phase 4 (REFACTOR): Task(Refactorer)  <- all code + green results
└─ Summary
```

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Copy to skills directory
cp -r tdd ~/.claude/skills/

# Interactive mode (pauses at each RED checkpoint)
/tdd "add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Autonomous mode (runs all slices, stops only on errors)
/tdd --auto "add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Resume a paused session
/tdd --resume

# Bug fix
/tdd "fix: cart total doesn't include tax"
```

**Design informed by:**
- [tdd-guard](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard) (hook-enforced TDD)
- [Matt Pocock's TDD Skill](https://www.aihero.dev/skill-test-driven-development-claude-code) (vertical slicing)
- [TDFlow](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.23761v1) (test quality as ceiling for implementation quality)
- [alexop.dev](https://alexop.dev/posts/custom-tdd-workflow-claude-code-vue/) (context isolation between phases)

**Use when:** Implementing features or fixing bugs where you want disciplined test-first development. Use `--auto` for maximum autonomy. The multi-agent architecture is especially valuable when single-context TDD produces tests that mirror implementation details.

### [Vault Daydream](./daydream/) ⭐ NEW
Multi-agent system that mines your Obsidian vault for non-obvious connections between notes, mimicking the brain's default mode network. Samples random note pairs, synthesizes connections via Sonnet, filters with Haiku critic. Inspired by [Gwern's LLM Daydreaming](https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming).

**Features:**
- 🧠 Simulates the brain's default mode network for knowledge vaults
- 🎲 Recency-weighted random pair sampling (50 pairs per run)
- 🔀 Multi-agent architecture: Sonnet synthesizer + Haiku critic in parallel batches
- 📊 Quality filtering: only insights scoring >= 7.0 average (novelty, coherence, usefulness)
- 📝 Obsidian-native output: individual insight notes with wikilinks + daily digest
- 🔄 History dedup: tracks previously sampled pairs to avoid repetition
- 📅 Daily note integration with daydream summary

**Architecture:**
```
Skill (orchestrator)
  |-- Glob/Read: scan vault, extract excerpts
  |-- Generate 50 random pairs (recency-weighted)
  |-- Task(model: sonnet) x 10: synthesize connections  <-- parallel
  |-- Task(model: haiku) x 10: critique/score insights  <-- parallel
  |-- Filter (avg >= 7.0)
  +-- Write: save insight notes + daily digest
```

No external dependencies -- pure Claude Code tools (Glob, Read, Write, Bash, Task).

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Copy to skills directory
cp -r daydream ~/.claude/skills/

# Edit instructions.md to set your VAULT_ROOT path
# Then invoke
/daydream
```

**Output:**
- `Daydreams/YYYYMMDD-slug.md` -- individual insight notes with scores and wikilinks
- `Daydreams/digests/YYYYMMDD-digest.md` -- daily digest with stats and ranked insights
- Daily note `## Daydream` section -- summary with top connections

**Cost:** ~$0.40-0.50 per run (~50 pairs) via Claude Code usage.

**Inspired by:** [Gwern's "LLM Daydreaming"](https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming) -- the idea that LLMs can productively "daydream" by finding unexpected connections between disparate pieces of knowledge, similar to how the brain's default mode network generates creative insights during idle periods.

**Use when:** You want to discover surprising connections across your knowledge base -- run daily or weekly to surface insights you wouldn't find through deliberate search.

---
