## Why this exists

AI agents are transforming cybersecurity — but they lack structured domain knowledge. A junior analyst knows which Volatility3 plugin to run on a suspicious memory dump. Your AI agent doesn't — unless you give it the skills.

**Anthropic Cybersecurity Skills** gives every AI agent instant access to **754 production-grade cybersecurity skills** spanning 26 security domains. Each skill follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard: YAML frontmatter for lightning-fast discovery, structured Markdown for step-by-step execution, and reference files for deep technical context.

**What makes v1.2.0 different from every other security skills repo:**

- **5-framework mapping** — Every skill is mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF 2.0, MITRE ATLAS v5.5, MITRE D3FEND v1.3, and NIST AI RMF 1.0. No other open-source library does this.
- **AI-native format** — Skills cost ~30 tokens to scan, provide full expert-level guidance when triggered, and work across 26+ AI agent platforms.
- **Real practitioner knowledge** — Not generated summaries. Structured workflows that mirror how senior security professionals actually work.

> 💡 **Why 5 frameworks matter:** Organizations face overlapping compliance requirements. A single skill like "analyzing-network-traffic-of-malware" maps to ATT&CK T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), NIST CSF DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring), ATLAS AML.T0047 (Evade ML Model), D3FEND D3-NTA (Network Traffic Analysis), and AI RMF MEASURE 2.6 (AI system monitoring). One skill, five compliance checkboxes.

### Progressive disclosure — why 754 skills don't slow your agent down

| Stage | Token cost | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Discovery scan | ~30 tokens | Always — agent reads YAML frontmatter |
| Full skill load | 500–2000 tokens | Only when skill matches the task |
| Deep reference pull | 1000–5000 tokens | Only when agent needs technical depth |

Irrelevant skills cost virtually nothing. Relevant skills provide complete expert-level guidance.

## 🧠 How AI agents use these skills

```
User prompt: "Analyze this memory dump for signs of credential theft"

Agent's internal process:
1. Scans 754 skill frontmatters (~30 tokens each) → finds 12 relevant skills
2. Loads top matches:
   - performing-memory-forensics-with-volatility3
   - hunting-for-credential-dumping-lsass
   - analyzing-windows-event-logs-for-credential-access
3. Follows structured workflow from SKILL.md
4. References ATT&CK T1003 (Credential Dumping) mapping
5. Maps findings to D3FEND D3-PSMD (Process Self-Modification Detection)
6. Outputs structured findings with framework references
```
