# check-hook.sh — verify the installed prepare-commit-msg hook is current.
#
# The installed hook's "AI Commit Attribution" block must byte-match the
# block in the shipped script (scripts/prepare-commit-msg). That block is
# the single source of truth for attribution logic and is extractable via
# its sed markers, so this check covers BOTH install modes:
#   (1) full copy of the shipped script, and
#   (2) the block appended into a pre-existing hook.
# Comparison is a content hash (git hash-object), not a version string, so
# ANY drift in the block is caught without remembering to bump a version.
#
# A third gate rejects HYBRID installs: attribution CODE left outside the
# markers (typically an older full copy of this hook with the current
# block appended behind it) runs before the current block, writes its own
# less-complete trailer first, and wins — the current block's dedupe check
# then skips. Only non-comment lines outside the block trigger it, so a
# pre-existing hook that merely mentions Generated-By in prose is fine.
#
# Usage:
#   check-hook.sh [HOOK_PATH]   # default: resolve via core.hooksPath, else
#                               # `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` (worktree-safe)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  hook installed, executable, attribution block current
#   1  hook missing, not executable, or attribution block differs
#
# Requires: bash 3.2+, git, sed. No other dependencies.
