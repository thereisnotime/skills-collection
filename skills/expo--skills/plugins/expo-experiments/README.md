# Expo Experiments

Experimental skills from the Expo team, for Expo APIs that are still evolving and not covered by stability guarantees.

This plugin is separate from the main `expo` plugin on purpose:

- Skills here target **experimental or pre-release Expo APIs**. Their guidance can change or become outdated as those APIs evolve.
- Skills may be **rewritten, renamed, or removed** between versions without the compatibility care the `expo` plugin gets.
- When the underlying API stabilizes, its skill **graduates to the `expo` plugin** and is removed from here.

If you are not deliberately using an experimental Expo API, install the main `expo` plugin instead.
