## What are Skills and Agents?

**Skills** are model-invoked capabilities that extend Claude Code's functionality. Unlike slash commands that require explicit user activation, Skills are automatically triggered by Claude based on context and the Skill's description.

Each Skill consists of a `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Detailed instructions for Claude
- Optional supporting files (scripts, templates, references)

**Agents** are specialized Claude instances that can be invoked by Claude to handle specific types of work. They run independently with their own context and can use different models optimized for their task.

Each Agent consists of an `AGENT.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, model selection)
- Specialized instructions and constraints
- Decision-making frameworks for their domain

Skills and Agents work together: Skills can orchestrate when to invoke Agents, and Agents can use Skills while executing their tasks.

## 🚀 NEW: Execution Runtime (90%+ Token Savings)

The marketplace now includes a **code execution environment** implementing the [Anthropic code execution pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp). Instead of loading code through context, Claude executes Python locally with API access—achieving **90-99% token reduction** for bulk operations.

### Quick Benefits

✅ **Massive token savings**: Process 100 files with 1K tokens instead of 100K
✅ **Faster operations**: Local execution vs multiple API round-trips
✅ **Stateful workflows**: Resume multi-step refactoring across sessions
✅ **Auto-secure**: PII/secret masking, sandboxed execution

### Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# After installing marketplace plugin
~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/mhattingpete-claude-skills/execution-runtime/setup.sh
```

### When It Activates

Skills automatically use execution mode for:
- Bulk operations (10+ files)
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Iterative processing
- Codebase-wide analysis

**Example**: "Rename getUserData to fetchUserData in all Python files"
- **Without execution**: ~25,000 tokens (read/edit 50 files)
- **With execution**: ~600 tokens (script + summary) - **97.6% savings**

```

### Best Practices

1. **Description is key**: Include both what the skill does AND when to use it
2. **Use gerund forms**: Name skills with "-ing" (e.g., "git-pushing", not "git-push")
3. **Keep concise**: Skills under 500 lines load faster
4. **Progressive disclosure**: Move detailed content to separate reference files
5. **Test across models**: Verify skills work with Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add a new skill:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your skill in a new directory
3. Follow the SKILL.md template and best practices

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's how the skills and agent work together for a typical feature development flow:

1. **User**: "Add user authentication to the app"
2. **`feature-planning` skill** activates and:
   - Asks clarifying questions (OAuth? JWT? Session-based?)
   - Explores codebase for existing patterns
   - Creates detailed plan with 8 discrete tasks
   - Reviews plan with user
3. **`plan-implementer` agent** executes each task:
   - Implements User model
   - Creates auth middleware
   - Adds login/logout endpoints
   - Builds frontend auth flow
4. **`test-fixing` skill** automatically activates if tests fail:
   - Identifies and groups test failures
   - Fixes issues systematically
5. **User**: "Push these changes"
6. **`git-pushing` skill** activates:
   - Creates conventional commit message
   - Pushes to remote branch
